**Diddy**: The function of Diddy is to create a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet that generates keys and addresses from a master key according to a specified network's parameters.

**Parameters**: The parameters for initializing this class.
· master_key (bytes): The master seed in bytes, used as the root for deriving all subsequent keys and addresses.
· network (dict): A dictionary containing the configuration parameters for the specific cryptocurrency network. This includes BIP32 version bytes (`bip32_prv`, `bip32_pub`) and address generation details.

**Code Description**: The `Diddy` class is an implementation of a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet, inheriting from the base `HDWallet` class. It is designed to generate a tree of cryptographic keys and corresponding addresses from a single master seed, adhering to the rules of a specific blockchain network.

Upon initialization, the class instance is configured with the provided `master_key` and `network` parameters. It internally creates a `Bip32` object from the `bip_utils` library, which is then used for all key derivation operations. This `Bip32` object is seeded with the master key and configured with the network's BIP32 version bytes.

The class provides three main methods for key and address generation:
· `get_private_key(index, path="m/44'/0'/0'/{i}")`: This method derives and returns a child private key. It uses the `index` to complete the specified derivation `path`, which defaults to the standard BIP44 path for the first account's external addresses ("m/44'/0'/0'/{i}"). It returns the raw private key as a `bytes` object.
· `get_public_key(index, path="m/44'/0'/0'/{i}")`: This method performs the same derivation as `get_private_key` but returns the corresponding raw compressed public key as a `bytes` object.
· `get_address(index, path="m/44'/0'/0'/{i}")`: This method generates the final, human-readable cryptocurrency address. It first calls `get_public_key` to obtain the compressed public key for the given `index` and `path`. It then uses the `zpywallet.create_address` utility function, passing the public key and the network configuration object to correctly format and encode the address. It returns the final address as a string.

**Note**:
· The `master_key` argument supplied to the constructor must be a `bytes` object.
· The `network` parameter must be a correctly structured dictionary containing all necessary keys for the target blockchain, such as `bip32_prv`, `bip32_pub`, and address version information.
· The `path` parameter in the methods is customizable to support non-standard derivation paths, but the default value is suitable for generating a sequence of standard user addresses.

**TftbDeprecationWarning**: A custom warning class used to signal that a feature within the tftb package is deprecated.
**Attributes**: This class does not introduce any new attributes. It inherits all attributes from its base class, `DeprecationWarning`.
**Code Description**: The `TftbDeprecationWarning` class is a specialized warning category for the `tftb` library. It is defined by inheriting directly from Python's built-in `DeprecationWarning`. The primary purpose of creating this custom class is to allow users and developers to distinguish deprecation warnings originating specifically from the `tftb` package from those issued by other libraries. The class itself has an empty implementation (`pass`), meaning it does not add or override any methods or attributes of its parent `DeprecationWarning`. Its value lies in its unique type, which can be used with Python's `warnings` module to filter, silence, or log `tftb`-specific deprecation notices. This class is typically raised by functions or methods that are scheduled for removal in future versions of the library to provide users with advance notice.
**Note**: By default, `DeprecationWarning` messages are not visible. To make them appear, developers may need to run their Python scripts with the `-Wd` command-line flag or configure the warning filters within their code using `warnings.simplefilter('always', TftbDeprecationWarning)`.

**on_fit_start**: This method initializes or resumes a Weights & Bienses (W&B) run at the beginning of a training session.

**Parameters**:
· trainer: The trainer object that controls the training process. This parameter is required by the callback signature but is not directly used within the method's logic.

**Code Description**:
This method is a callback that is automatically executed at the very beginning of the training process (the "fit" phase). Its primary responsibility is to set up the connection to the Weights & Biases platform for experiment tracking.

The core logic checks if a W&B run has already been initialized by examining the `self.run` attribute. If `self.run` is not set, it calls `wandb.init()` to create and start a new run or resume an existing one. This idempotency ensures that the initialization happens only once.

The `wandb.init()` function is configured with several key parameters derived from the logger's attributes:
· `entity`: The W&B username or team name.
· `project`: The name of the project under which the run will be saved.
· `name`: The specific display name for this individual run.
· `config`: A dictionary of all training arguments and hyperparameters (`vars(self.args)`). This is crucial for tracking the configuration used for each experiment.
· `id`: A unique identifier for the run (`self.run_id`).
· `resume="allow"`: This setting enables the ability to resume an interrupted run. If a run with the given `id` already exists, W&B will append new logs to it instead of starting a new one.

The resulting W&B run object is stored in the `self.run` attribute, making it accessible to other callback methods for logging metrics, images, or artifacts during the training lifecycle.

**Note**: For this method to function correctly, the `entity`, `project`, `name`, `args`, and `run_id` attributes must be properly configured on the `WandbLogger` instance before training begins.

**Return**:
This method does not return any value.
