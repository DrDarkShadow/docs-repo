## FunctionDef add(a, b)
# Function: add(a, b)

## Overview

The `add` function calculates the sum of two provided arguments.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `a` | Number | The first number or addend. |
| `b` | Number | The second number or addend. |

## Description

This function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. It uses the standard addition operator (`+`) to perform the calculation. The function is straightforward and directly returns the result of `a + b`.

For example, if `a` is `5` and `b` is `10`, the function will compute `5 + 10` and return the value `15`.

```javascript
// The core logic of the function
return a + b;
```

## Usage Notes

- This function is designed for numeric inputs (integers or floating-point numbers).
- If string values are provided, the `+` operator in JavaScript will perform string concatenation instead of arithmetic addition. For example, `add("5", "10")` would result in the string `"510"`.
- The function handles both positive and negative numbers.

**Output Example**: A numeric value representing the sum.
```
15
```

## Example

```javascript
// Example usage with two integers
let result = add(5, 10);
console.log(result);

// Example usage with floating-point numbers
let floatResult = add(3.14, 2.71);
console.log(floatResult);
```

**Output:**

```
15
5.85
```

### FunctionDef add
# Function: add(a, b)

## Overview

The `add` function is intended to calculate the sum of two numbers.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `a` | Number | The first number to be added. |
| `b` | Number | The second number to be added. |

## Description

This function is designed to accept two arguments, `a` and `b`, and return their sum.

As currently written, the function is a stub with an empty body. It does not contain any logic to perform the addition. Therefore, when called, it will execute without performing any operations and will implicitly return `undefined`.

To make the function operational, it must be implemented to return the sum of its parameters. A correct implementation would be:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

## Usage Notes

- This function is currently a placeholder and does not perform any calculation in its present state.
- Calling the function as is will always result in a return value of `undefined`.
- The function must be completed by adding the return statement `return a + b;` to fulfill its intended purpose.

## Example

```javascript
// Example of intended usage
let result = add(10, 5);
console.log(result);
```

**Output:**

```
undefined
```
**(Note: The current output is `undefined` because the function body is empty. After implementing the addition logic `return a + b;`, the expected output would be `15`.)**

## FunctionDef factorial(n)
# Function: factorial(n)

## Overview

The `factorial` function recursively calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

## Parameters

*   `n` (Number): The non-negative integer for which the factorial will be calculated.

## Description

This function computes the factorial of a number `n` using a recursive approach. The factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

The function's logic is based on two main cases:

1.  **Base Case**: The recursion terminates when `n` is less than or equal to 1. By definition, the factorial of 0 (`0!`) and 1 (`1!`) is 1. In this case, the function returns `1`.

2.  **Recursive Step**: If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the product of `n` and the result of calling `factorial` with the argument `n - 1`. This process continues until the base case is reached.

For example, `factorial(4)` is calculated as follows:
`4 * factorial(3)`
`4 * (3 * factorial(2))`
`4 * (3 * (2 * factorial(1)))`
`4 * (3 * (2 * 1))` = `24`

```javascript
// The core logic uses a ternary operator as a compact if-else statement.
return n <= 1 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
```

## Usage Notes

-   This function is designed for non-negative integers. Providing a negative number will cause infinite recursion, leading to a "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error.
-   Due to its recursive nature, calculating the factorial of very large numbers can also lead to a stack overflow error. For such cases, an iterative approach might be more suitable.
-   The input `n` is expected to be an integer. While it may work for floating-point numbers until the base case, the mathematical concept of a factorial is typically defined for integers.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single number representing the calculated factorial. For an input of `5`, the output would be:
`120`

## Example

```javascript
// Example usage of the factorial function
const number = 5;
const result = factorial(number);

console.log(`The factorial of ${number} is ${result}`);
```

**Output:**

```
The factorial of 5 is 120
```

### FunctionDef factorial
# Function: factorial(n)

## Overview

The `factorial` function calculates and returns the factorial of a non-negative integer.

## parameters

- `n`: `Number` - The non-negative integer for which to calculate the factorial.

## Description

This function computes the factorial of a given number `n`. The factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. For example, `5!` is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`, which equals `120`.

The function is typically implemented using recursion. It operates based on two primary cases:
1.  **Base Case:** If `n` is `0` or `1`, the function returns `1`. By mathematical definition, the factorial of 0 (`0!`) is 1, and the factorial of 1 (`1!`) is also 1.
2.  **Recursive Step:** If `n` is greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument `n - 1` and multiplies the result by `n`. This recursive process unwinds until it reaches the base case.

Factorials are not defined for negative numbers. This function will typically return `undefined` or `NaN` if a negative number is provided as an argument.

## Usage Notes

- This function is designed for non-negative integers. Passing a negative number as an argument will not yield a valid factorial.
- Factorial values increase very quickly. For inputs larger than `170`, the result may exceed JavaScript's maximum representable number (`Number.MAX_VALUE`) and return `Infinity`.
- When using a recursive implementation for this function, very large numbers for `n` can potentially cause a "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error. For such scenarios, an iterative approach is more memory-efficient.

## Example

```javascript
// Example usage
// Note: The function implementation is assumed for this example.
const result = factorial(5);
console.log(`The factorial of 5 is: ${result}`);

const resultForZero = factorial(0);
console.log(`The factorial of 0 is: ${resultForZero}`);

const resultForNegative = factorial(-3);
console.log(`The factorial of -3 is: ${resultForNegative}`);
```

**Output:**

```
The factorial of 5 is: 120
The factorial of 0 is: 1
The factorial of -3 is: undefined
```

## FunctionDef greet(name)
# Function: greet

## Overview

The `greet` function logs a personalized greeting message to the console.

## parameters

- `name` (String): The name to be included in the greeting message.

## Description

This function provides a simple way to display a standardized greeting. It takes a single parameter, `name`, which is intended to be a string.

The core logic resides within a `console.log()` statement. It utilizes a template literal (`` ` ``) to construct the output string. The string `Hello, ` is combined with the value of the `name` parameter, followed by an exclamation mark `!`. The resulting string is then printed directly to the console.

For example, if the string `"World"` is passed as the `name`, the function will output `Hello, World!` to the console.

## Usage Notes

- This function does not return a value; its primary effect is the side effect of printing to the console.
- If a non-string value (e.g., a number or an object) is passed as the `name` parameter, JavaScript will attempt to convert it to its string representation before printing.

## Example

```python
// Example usage
greet("Alice");
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, Alice!
```

***
### FunctionDef greet
# Function: greet

## Overview

The `greet` function is a placeholder intended to perform a greeting action using the provided name.

## parameters

- `name`: **any** - The name to be used in the greeting. The intended type is likely a string.

## Description

The `greet` function is defined to accept a single argument, `name`. The function body is currently empty, meaning it contains no executable code. As a result, when this function is called, it performs no actions and does not produce any output. In JavaScript, a function that does not have an explicit `return` statement will implicitly return `undefined`. This function serves as a stub or placeholder for future implementation.

## Usage Notes

- As the function body is empty, calling `greet` will have no side effects (e.g., no console output).
- The function will always return `undefined` in its current state.
- This function must be implemented with logic to be useful for its intended purpose of greeting.

## Example

```javascript
// Example usage
let result = greet("Alice");
console.log("The function returned:", result);
```

**Output:**

```
The function returned: undefined
```
