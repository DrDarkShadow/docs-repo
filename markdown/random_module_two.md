## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
**count_vowels**: The function of count_vowels is to calculate the total number of vowels within a given string, treating uppercase and lowercase vowels the same.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 text: The input string that will be scanned for vowels.

**Code Description**:
The function begins by defining a set named `vowels` which contains all lowercase and uppercase English vowels (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U). It then iterates through each character (`ch`) of the input `text`. For each character, it checks if the character is present in the `vowels` set. A generator expression produces the number `1` for every character that is found in the set. Finally, the built-in `sum()` function is used to add up all the generated `1`s, yielding the total count of vowels, which is then returned.

**Note**:
The vowel check is case-insensitive because the `vowels` set explicitly includes both lowercase and uppercase letters. Using a set for vowel lookup is an efficient method for checking membership.

**Output Example**:
Calling `count_vowels("Hello World")` returns `3`.
## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
**pairwise_sum**: The function of pairwise_sum is to compute the arithmetic sum of an iterable of numbers using the Kahan summation algorithm for improved numerical precision.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 numbers: An iterable containing float or integer values that will be summed together.

**Code Description**:
The function initializes a `total` and a `compensation` variable to `0.0`. It then iterates through each `value` in the input `numbers` iterable. Inside the loop, it first calculates a corrected value `y` by subtracting the current `compensation` from the input `value` (cast to a float). Next, it computes a temporary sum `t` by adding `y` to the running `total`. The `compensation` variable is then updated to capture the numerical error from the previous addition; this is calculated as `(t - total) - y`. Finally, the `total` is updated to the value of `t`. After the loop has processed all numbers, the function returns the final `total`.

**Note**:
This function implements the Kahan summation algorithm, which is designed to reduce the accumulation of floating-point errors that can occur with a naive summation, especially when dealing with a large set of numbers or numbers of widely varying magnitudes.

**Output Example**:
```python
pairwise_sum([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5])
```
```
1.5
```
## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
**split_into_chunks**: The function of split_into_chunks is to divide a given string into a sequence of smaller substrings of a specified maximum length.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 text: The input string that will be divided into chunks.
路 size: An integer specifying the length of each chunk. This value must be positive.

**Code Description**:
The function first validates the `size` parameter. It checks if `size` is less than or equal to zero. If this condition is true, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "size must be positive" and execution stops.

If `size` is a positive number, the function proceeds to split the `text`. It uses a generator expression that iterates through the `text` string with a step equal to `size`. The `range` function generates start indices (0, `size`, 2 * `size`, etc.) up to the length of the text. For each start index `i`, a slice of the string `text[i : i + size]` is created. This slice represents one chunk.

Finally, all the generated chunks are collected into a tuple, which is then returned as the result.

**Note**:
The function requires the `size` parameter to be a positive integer; otherwise, it will raise a `ValueError`. The last substring in the returned tuple may be shorter than the specified `size` if the total length of the input `text` is not evenly divisible by `size`.

**Output Example**:
Calling `split_into_chunks("abcdefgh", 3)` returns `('abc', 'def', 'gh')`.
