## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
## Function: count_vowels
The function of **count_vowels** is to count and return the total number of vowels within a given input string in a case-insensitive manner.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 text: The input string to be scanned for vowels.

**Code Description**:
The function begins by defining a set named `vowels` which contains all lowercase and uppercase English vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). It then uses a generator expression to iterate through each character (`ch`) in the input `text`. For each character, it checks if the character is present in the `vowels` set. If a character is a vowel, the generator yields the number `1`. Finally, the `sum()` function is used to add up all the `1`s produced by the generator, effectively counting the total number of vowels. This final count is returned as an integer.

**Note**:
The vowel check is case-insensitive because the `vowels` set explicitly includes both lowercase and uppercase letters. Any characters in the input `text` that are not vowels (including consonants, numbers, and symbols) are ignored.

**Output Example**:
```python
# Calling the function with the string "Hello World"
count_vowels("Hello World")

# The function returns the integer 3
3
```
## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
## Function: pairwise_sum
The function of **pairwise_sum** is to compute the arithmetic sum of an iterable of numbers using a numerically stable approach to improve precision.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 `numbers`: An iterable containing float or integer values that will be summed.

**Code Description**: 
This function implements the Kahan summation algorithm to minimize floating-point errors. It initializes two floating-point variables, `total` and `compensation`, to `0.0`. The function then iterates through each `value` in the input `numbers` iterable.

Inside the loop, it first calculates a corrected value `y` by subtracting the `compensation` from the current `value`. This `compensation` term holds the error from the previous iteration's addition. Next, it calculates a temporary sum `t` by adding the corrected value `y` to the running `total`. The new `compensation` value is then calculated by finding the difference `(t - total) - y`, which effectively captures the low-order bits (the error) lost in the `t = total + y` operation. Finally, the `total` is updated to the value of `t`.

After the loop has processed all values in the iterable, the function returns the final `total`.

**Note**: 
This function is particularly useful for summing a large number of floating-point values where standard summation might accumulate significant precision errors. It provides a more accurate result than Python's built-in `sum()` for such cases.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Calling pairwise_sum([0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1])
1.0
```
## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
## Function: split_into_chunks
The function of **split_into_chunks** is to split a given string into a series of smaller, fixed-size substrings.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 `text`: The string to be split into chunks.
路 `size`: The integer length for each chunk. This value must be positive.

**Code Description**:
The function first checks if the provided `size` parameter is less than or equal to zero. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "size must be positive". If `size` is a positive number, the function proceeds to slice the input `text`. It uses a generator expression that iterates from the start of the string to its end, with a step equal to `size`. In each step, it creates a substring of length `size` starting from the current index. These substrings are then collected into a tuple, which is returned. The last substring in the tuple may be shorter than `size` if the length of the original text is not a multiple of `size`.

**Note**:
The function will raise a `ValueError` if the `size` argument is zero or a negative number. The last chunk in the returned tuple can be shorter than the specified `size`.

**Output Example**:
```python
('sub', 'str', 'ing')
```
