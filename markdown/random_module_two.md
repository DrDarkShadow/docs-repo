## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
Function - count_vowels:

Purpose:
Counts the total number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) within a given string in a case-insensitive manner.

Parameters:
• text (str): The input string to be scanned for vowel characters.

Detailed Description:
The function calculates the number of vowels present in the input `text` string. It first initializes a `set` containing all lowercase and uppercase vowels ("a", "e", "i", "o", "u", "A", "E", "I", "O", "U"). Using a set allows for efficient, constant-time lookups.

The function then iterates through each character of the input `text` string. For every character, it checks if that character exists within the predefined `vowels` set. A generator expression `(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)` yields the number `1` for each character that is confirmed to be a vowel. Finally, the built-in `sum()` function is used to total all the generated `1`s, producing the final count of vowels, which is then returned.

Important Notes:
• The vowel check is case-insensitive because the `vowels` set contains both lowercase and uppercase letters.
• Non-alphabetic characters, consonants, numbers, and whitespace within the input string are ignored and do not affect the count.
• If an empty string is passed as the `text` parameter, the function will correctly return `0`.
• The function has no external dependencies and does not raise any custom exceptions.

**Output Example**:
```
7
```

Usage Example:
```python
# Example 1: Counting vowels in a mixed-case sentence
sentence = "This is an Example String."
vowel_count = count_vowels(sentence)
print(f"The number of vowels is: {vowel_count}")
# Expected Output: The number of vowels is: 7

# Example 2: Counting vowels in a string with no vowels
no_vowels_text = "Rhythm fly by."
vowel_count = count_vowels(no_vowels_text)
print(f"The number of vowels is: {vowel_count}")
# Expected Output: The number of vowels is: 0

# Example 3: Counting vowels in an empty string
empty_text = ""
vowel_count = count_vowels(empty_text)
print(f"The number of vowels is: {vowel_count}")
# Expected Output: The number of vowels is: 0
```
## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
Function - pairwise_sum:

Purpose:
Computes the arithmetic sum of an iterable of numbers using the Kahan summation algorithm for improved numerical precision.

Parameters:
• numbers (Iterable[float]): An iterable collection of numbers, such as a list or tuple. The elements can be floats or integers, as each value is internally converted to a float before being added to the sum.

Detailed Description:
This function calculates the sum of a sequence of numbers while minimizing the floating-point errors that can accumulate during summation. It implements the Kahan summation algorithm, a technique that provides greater accuracy than a simple iterative sum, especially when dealing with numbers of widely varying magnitudes.

The function initializes two variables: `total` to `0.0` to store the running sum, and `compensation` to `0.0` to track the accumulated rounding error. It then iterates through each `value` in the input `numbers` iterable.

For each value, the following steps are performed:
1.  A corrected value `y` is calculated by subtracting the `compensation` (the error from the previous step) from the current `value`.
2.  This corrected value `y` is added to the running `total`, and the result is stored in a temporary variable `t`.
3.  The new error introduced by the addition is calculated as `(t - total) - y`. This captures the low-order bits that were lost due to finite precision and stores them in the `compensation` variable for the next iteration.
4.  The `total` is updated with the value of `t`.

After iterating through all the numbers, the function returns the final `total`, which is a more precise representation of the true sum.

Important Notes:
• This function is particularly useful when summing a large set of floating-point numbers or when the numbers have significantly different magnitudes, as it mitigates the loss of precision inherent in standard floating-point arithmetic.
• The function expects an iterable of numeric types. If an element in the iterable cannot be converted to a float (e.g., a string), a `ValueError` or `TypeError` will be raised at runtime.
• No external libraries or modules are required.

**Output Example**:
```
2.0
```

Usage Example:
```python
# A list of floats where standard summation might lose precision.
# The correct sum is 2.0.
data = [1.0, 1e100, 1.0, -1e100]

# Calculate the sum using the numerically stable pairwise_sum function.
stable_result = pairwise_sum(data)
print(f"The stable sum is: {stable_result}")

# Example with a simple list of numbers.
numbers_list = [15.5, 20.0, -5.25, 100.0]
simple_sum = pairwise_sum(numbers_list)
print(f"The sum is: {simple_sum}")
```
**Expected Output:**
```
The stable sum is: 2.0
The sum is: 130.25
```
## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
Function - split_into_chunks:

Purpose:
Splits a given string into a tuple of smaller, fixed-size substrings.

Parameters:
• text (str): The input string that will be divided into chunks.
• size (int): The desired maximum length for each chunk. This value is required to be a positive integer.

Detailed Description:
This function divides a string into multiple segments of a specified length. The function first performs a validation check on the `size` parameter. If `size` is zero or a negative number, it raises a `ValueError` to indicate that the chunk length must be positive.

If the `size` is valid, the function proceeds with the splitting logic. It uses a generator expression that iterates over the indices of the input `text` with a step equal to `size`. The `range` function is configured to start at index 0, go up to the length of the string, and increment by the `size` value at each step. For each generated index `i`, the function uses string slicing (`text[i : i + size]`) to extract a substring. This process continues until the entire string has been processed. The resulting substrings are collected into a tuple, which is then returned.

Important Notes:
• The function will raise a `ValueError` if the provided `size` is not a positive integer (i.e., if `size` <= 0).
• The final substring in the returned tuple may be shorter than the specified `size` if the total length of the input `text` is not an even multiple of `size`.
• This function does not require any external libraries.

**Output Example**:
```
('Hel', 'loW', 'orl', 'd')
```

Usage Example:
```python
# Example 1: Splitting a string where the length is not a multiple of the size
text_to_split = "This is a sample string for chunking."
chunk_size = 10
chunks = split_into_chunks(text_to_split, chunk_size)
print(chunks)
# Expected Output: ('This is a ', 'sample str', 'ing for ch', 'unking.')

# Example 2: Splitting a string where the length is a multiple of the size
text_to_split_even = "abcdefghij"
chunk_size_even = 5
chunks_even = split_into_chunks(text_to_split_even, chunk_size_even)
print(chunks_even)
# Expected Output: ('abcde', 'fghij')

# Example 3: Attempting to use an invalid size
try:
    invalid_chunks = split_into_chunks("some text", 0)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
# Expected Output: Error: size must be positive
```
