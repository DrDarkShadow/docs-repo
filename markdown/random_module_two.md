## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
## Function count_vowels
**count_vowels**: The function of count_vowels is to count the total number of vowels within a given input string in a case-insensitive manner.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 text: The input string to be scanned for vowels.

**Code Description**: 
The function initializes a set named `vowels` containing all lowercase and uppercase English vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). It then iterates through each character (`ch`) of the input `text`. For each character, it checks if the character is present in the `vowels` set. A generator expression yields the number `1` for every character that is a vowel. Finally, the built-in `sum()` function calculates the total of all the generated `1`s, effectively counting the vowels, and returns this sum.

**Note**: 
The check for vowels is case-insensitive because the `vowels` set explicitly includes both uppercase and lowercase vowel characters. The function only considers 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' as vowels and does not account for other characters like 'y'.

**Output Example**: 
```python
3
```
## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
## Function pairwise_sum
**pairwise_sum**: The function of pairwise_sum is to compute the sum of an iterable of numbers using a numerically stable approach known as Kahan summation.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 `numbers`: An iterable containing float or integer values to be summed.

**Code Description**: 
The function initializes a `total` and a `compensation` variable, both to `0.0`. It then iterates through each `value` in the input `numbers` iterable.

Inside the loop, it first calculates a corrected value `y` by subtracting the `compensation` from the current `value` (which is cast to a float). This `compensation` term holds the error from the previous summation step. Next, it calculates a temporary sum `t` by adding the corrected value `y` to the running `total`. A new `compensation` value is then computed by finding the difference between the new sum `t` and the original `total`, and then subtracting `y`. This captures the low-order bits lost in the `t = total + y` operation. Finally, the `total` is updated to the value of `t`.

After the loop has processed all the numbers, the function returns the final `total`.

**Note**: 
This function implements the Kahan summation algorithm, which significantly reduces numerical error compared to a naive summation, especially when summing many floating-point numbers or numbers of widely different magnitudes. All input values are cast to `float` during the computation.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Calling pairwise_sum([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5])
0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.5
```
```
1.5
```

## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
## Function split_into_chunks
**split_into_chunks**: The function of split_into_chunks is to divide a string into a tuple of smaller, fixed-size substrings.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 `text`: The input string that will be split into chunks.
路 `size`: An integer specifying the desired length for each chunk. This value must be positive.

**Code Description**: 
The function first validates the `size` parameter. If `size` is less than or equal to zero, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "size must be positive". If `size` is valid, the function proceeds to split the `text`. It uses a generator expression within a `tuple()` constructor to create the chunks. The `range()` function generates starting indices for each chunk, beginning at 0 and incrementing by the `size` value until the end of the string is reached. For each starting index `i`, a slice of the string `text[i : i + size]` is created. This process continues until the entire string has been chunked. The resulting substrings are collected into a tuple and returned.

**Note**: 
The final substring in the returned tuple may be shorter than the specified `size` if the length of the input `text` is not an even multiple of `size`. A `ValueError` will be raised if the `size` parameter is not a positive number.

**Output Example**: 
```python
('hel', 'lo ', 'wor', 'ld')
```
