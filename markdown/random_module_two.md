## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
# Function: count_vowels(text: str)

## Overview

The `count_vowels` function calculates the total number of vowels within a given input string in a case-insensitive manner.

## parameters

- `text` (str): The input string to be scanned for vowels.

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to count vowel occurrences in a string. The core logic is executed in two main steps:

1.  A `set` named `vowels` is initialized with all lowercase and uppercase English vowels (`"aeiouAEIOU"`). Using a `set` allows for very fast membership checking, which is more efficient than searching through a list or string repeatedly.

2.  The function then uses a generator expression, `(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)`, to iterate through each character (`ch`) of the input `text`. For every character that is found within the `vowels` set, the number `1` is generated.

Finally, the built-in `sum()` function is called on this generator. It consumes all the generated `1`s and adds them together, producing the total count of vowels, which is then returned as an integer.

```python
# Internal logic breakdown
vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
# For an input "Test", the generator would yield 1 for 'e'.
# sum() would then calculate the total, returning 1.
return sum(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)
```

## Usage Notes

- The function is case-insensitive because the `vowels` set contains both `aeiou` and `AEIOU`.
- Only the standard English vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are counted. Vowels with accents or from other alphabets (e.g., 'á', 'ü', 'ø') will not be counted.
- Any non-vowel characters, including consonants, numbers, whitespace, and symbols, are ignored.

**Output Example**: The function returns an integer representing the total count of vowels.
```
7
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
input_string = "This is a Simple Test String 123!"
vowel_count = count_vowels(input_string)
print(f"The text is: '{input_string}'")
print(f"The number of vowels is: {vowel_count}")
```

**Output:**

```
The text is: 'This is a Simple Test String 123!'
The number of vowels is: 7
```

## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
# Function: pairwise_sum(numbers: Iterable[float])

## Overview

The `pairwise_sum` function computes the sum of an iterable of numbers using the Kahan summation algorithm, which provides a more numerically stable and precise result compared to a naive summation, especially for floating-point numbers.

## parameters

- `numbers` (Iterable[float]): An iterable collection of numbers (floats or integers) that need to be summed. This can be a list, tuple, or any other iterable object.

## Description

This function provides a robust method for summing floating-point numbers by minimizing rounding errors that can accumulate during computation. Standard summation can lose precision, particularly when adding a very small number to a very large one. This function implements the Kahan summation algorithm to counteract this effect.

The algorithm works by maintaining a running `compensation` variable that accumulates the error from each addition.

The logic proceeds as follows:
1.  Initialize `total` and `compensation` to `0.0`.
2.  Iterate through each `value` in the input `numbers`.
3.  For each `value`, it is first cast to a `float`.
4.  The `compensation` from the previous step is subtracted from the current `value` to create a corrected value `y`. This reintroduces the "lost" part from the prior addition.
    `y = float(value) - compensation`
5.  The corrected value `y` is added to the running `total`. Due to floating-point limitations, this addition may still be imprecise.
    `t = total + y`
6.  The error from the addition in the previous step is calculated and stored in `compensation`. This is done by observing the difference between the result `t` and the original `total`, and then subtracting `y`. If the addition were perfect, this would be zero.
    `compensation = (t - total) - y`
7.  The `total` is updated with the new sum `t`.
8.  After iterating through all numbers, the final, more accurate `total` is returned.

```python
# Inside the loop
y = float(value) - compensation
t = total + y
compensation = (t - total) - y
total = t
```

This process ensures that the low-order bits, which are often lost in standard floating-point addition, are carried over to the next iteration, leading to a final sum with higher precision.

## Usage Notes

- This function is highly recommended when accuracy is critical and the dataset involves summing a large quantity of floating-point numbers or numbers with a wide range of magnitudes.
- While Python's built-in `sum()` function is often sufficient, `pairwise_sum` provides an explicit and reliable implementation of a high-precision summation algorithm.
- Any integers provided in the input `numbers` iterable will be automatically converted to floats during the calculation.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single floating-point number.
```
51.000000123
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
# A list containing numbers of vastly different magnitudes
data = [150000.75, 0.000000123, 50.25, -150000.0]
result = pairwise_sum(data)
print(result)

# Another example with a generator
data_generator = (i * 0.1 for i in range(10))
result_from_generator = pairwise_sum(data_generator)
print(result_from_generator)
```

**Output:**

```
51.000000123
4.5
```

## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
# Function: split_into_chunks(text: str, size: int)

## Overview

The `split_into_chunks` function divides a given string into a series of smaller, fixed-size substrings.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `text` | str | The input string that will be divided into chunks. |
| `size` | int | The desired length for each chunk. This value must be a positive integer. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to segment a string into multiple parts of a specified length.

The function first validates the `size` parameter. If `size` is less than or equal to zero, it is not a valid length for a chunk, so the function raises a `ValueError`.

If the `size` is valid, the function proceeds to slice the string. It uses a generator expression within a `tuple()` constructor for efficiency. The `range(0, len(text), size)` function generates the starting indices for each chunk. For each index `i`, a slice `text[i : i + size]` is created. This slice starts at index `i` and extends up to, but not including, index `i + size`.

The resulting substrings are collected into a tuple, which is then returned. If the length of the input `text` is not a multiple of `size`, the final chunk in the tuple will be shorter than the specified `size`.

```python
# Internal logic for a text "abcdefg" and size 3
# 1. Validate size: 3 > 0, so it's valid.
# 2. Generate indices using range(0, 7, 3), which yields 0, 3, 6.
# 3. For index 0: text[0:3] -> "abc"
# 4. For index 3: text[3:6] -> "def"
# 5. For index 6: text[6:9] -> "g" (slice automatically stops at the end of the string)
# 6. Return the collected chunks as a tuple: ("abc", "def", "g")
```

## Usage Notes

- The function will raise a `ValueError` if the `size` parameter is zero or a negative number.
- The last element in the returned tuple may be shorter than `size` if the total length of the `text` is not evenly divisible by `size`.
- If an empty string is passed as the `text` parameter, the function will return an empty tuple `()`.
- The return type is always a `tuple` of strings.

**Output Example**: A possible return value for a successful operation.

```
('This ', 'is a ', 'sampl', 'e.')
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
long_string = "This is a sample string for demonstrating the chunking function."
chunk_length = 10

# Split the string into chunks of 10 characters
chunks = split_into_chunks(long_string, chunk_length)
print(chunks)

# Example with a string length not divisible by chunk size
short_string = "123456789"
short_chunks = split_into_chunks(short_string, 4)
print(short_chunks)

# Example of invalid size
try:
    split_into_chunks("some text", 0)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

**Output:**

```
('This is a ', 'sample str', 'ing for de', 'monstratin', 'g the chun', 'king funct', 'ion.')
('1234', '5678', '9')
size must be positive
```
