## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
## Function count_vowels
**count_vowels**: The function of count_vowels is to count the total number of vowels within a given string in a case-insensitive manner.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 text: The input string to be scanned for vowels.

**Code Description**: 
The function initializes a `set` named `vowels` containing all lowercase and uppercase English vowels (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U). It then iterates through each character (`ch`) of the input `text`. For each character, it checks if the character is present in the `vowels` set. A generator expression yields the number `1` for every character that is found in the set. Finally, the built-in `sum()` function calculates the total of all the generated `1`s, effectively counting the vowels, and returns this sum as an integer.

**Note**: 
The check for vowels is case-insensitive because the `vowels` set explicitly includes both uppercase and lowercase letters. Using a set for vowel lookup is highly efficient.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Calling count_vowels("Hello World") returns:
3
```
## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
## Function pairwise_sum
**pairwise_sum**: The function of pairwise_sum is to compute the arithmetic sum of an iterable of numbers using the Kahan summation algorithm for improved numerical precision.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 `numbers`: An iterable collection of floating-point or integer values to be summed.

**Code Description**: 
The function initializes two floating-point variables, `total` and `compensation`, to `0.0`. It then iterates through each `value` in the input `numbers` iterable.

Inside the loop, for each value:
1. A corrected value `y` is calculated by subtracting the current `compensation` from the input `value`. This step adjusts the current number by the error from the previous addition.
2. A temporary sum `t` is computed by adding the corrected value `y` to the running `total`.
3. The `compensation` variable is updated to capture the numerical error (the low-order bits) lost in the previous step. This is calculated as `(t - total) - y`.
4. The main `total` is updated to the value of the temporary sum `t`.

After the loop has processed all the numbers, the function returns the final `total`.

**Note**: 
This function implements the Kahan summation algorithm, which is designed to minimize the accumulation of floating-point errors. It is more numerically stable than a simple `sum()` when dealing with a large set of numbers or numbers with widely varying magnitudes.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Calling the function with a list of floats
result = pairwise_sum([100000000.0, 3.14159, -100000000.0])

# The expected output would be approximately 3.14159
# result: 3.14159
```
## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
## Function split_into_chunks
**split_into_chunks**: The function of split_into_chunks is to divide a given string into a sequence of smaller, fixed-size substrings.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 `text` (str): The input string that will be divided into chunks.
路 `size` (int): The desired maximum length for each chunk. This value must be a positive integer.

**Code Description**: 
The function first validates the `size` parameter. It checks if `size` is less than or equal to zero. If it is, the function raises a `ValueError` with the message "size must be positive" to prevent invalid operations.

If `size` is a positive number, the function proceeds to split the `text`. It uses a generator expression within a `tuple()` constructor. The `range()` function generates a sequence of starting indices for each chunk, starting from 0, up to the length of the text, incrementing by `size` in each step. For each index `i` generated by the range, a slice of the `text` is taken from `i` to `i + size`. This creates a substring of length `size`. The final substring may be shorter if the total length of the text is not evenly divisible by `size`. All the generated substrings are collected into a tuple, which is then returned.

**Note**: 
The `size` parameter must be a positive integer; otherwise, a `ValueError` will be raised. The last element in the returned tuple may have a length less than the specified `size`.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Calling split_into_chunks("HelloWorld", 3) returns:
('Hel', 'loW', 'orl', 'd')
```
