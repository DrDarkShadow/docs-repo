## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
# Function: count_vowels(text: str) -> int

## Overview

The `count_vowels` function counts the total number of vowels within a given string in a case-insensitive manner.

## parameters

-   `text` (str): The input string in which to count the vowels.

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to determine the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a text string.

The logic begins by defining a `set` named `vowels` which contains all lowercase and uppercase English vowels (`"aeiouAEIOU"`). Using a set is highly efficient for checking if a character exists within it.

The function then iterates through each character (`ch`) of the input `text`. For each character, it checks for its presence in the `vowels` set. A generator expression, `(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)`, yields the number `1` every time a character from the `text` is found in the `vowels` set.

Finally, the built-in `sum()` function is called on this generator. It calculates the total sum of all the `1`s generated, which corresponds to the total count of vowels in the string. This final sum is then returned.

```python
# Internal logic breakdown
vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
# For a text like "Hi", the generator would be (1 for 'H' in vowels, 1 for 'i' in vowels)
# This evaluates to a generator that yields one '1' for the 'i'.
# sum() then calculates the total, which is 1.
return sum(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)
```

## Usage Notes

-   The vowel counting is case-insensitive. For example, 'a' and 'A' are both counted as vowels.
-   Characters that are not vowels, including consonants, numbers, whitespace, and symbols, are ignored.
-   The function is designed to work with string inputs. Providing a non-string type may lead to a `TypeError`.

**Output Example**: The function returns an integer representing the total count of vowels.

## Example

```python
# Example usage
input_sentence = "Hello World! This is a test."
vowel_count = count_vowels(input_sentence)
print(f"The number of vowels is: {vowel_count}")
```

**Output:**

```
The number of vowels is: 8
```

## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
# Function: pairwise_sum(numbers: Iterable[float])

## Overview

The `pairwise_sum` function computes the arithmetic sum of a sequence of numbers using a numerically stable algorithm to minimize floating-point errors.

## parameters

- `numbers`: An iterable (e.g., a list, tuple) of numeric values (integers or floats) to be summed.

## Description

This function provides a more accurate method for summing floating-point numbers compared to the standard built-in `sum()` function. It implements the Kahan summation algorithm, which is designed to reduce the accumulation of numerical errors that can occur when adding numbers of different magnitudes or when summing a large set of values.

The algorithm works by maintaining a running `total` and a `compensation` variable, which tracks the "lost" low-order bits from previous additions.

The logic proceeds as follows:
1.  Initialize `total` and `compensation` to `0.0`.
2.  For each `value` in the input `numbers` iterable:
    a. The `value` is first corrected by subtracting the `compensation` from the previous iteration. This corrected value is stored in `y`.
    b. The corrected value `y` is added to the running `total`, and the result is stored in a temporary variable `t`. This is the step where precision loss can occur.
    c. The new `compensation` value is calculated as `(t - total) - y`. This formula precisely captures the numerical error (the part of `y` that was lost) during the addition of `total + y`.
    d. The `total` is updated with the value of `t`.
3.  After iterating through all numbers, the final `total` is returned, which is a more accurate representation of the true sum.

```python
# Kahan summation for improved precision
total = 0.0
compensation = 0.0
for value in numbers:
    y = float(value) - compensation
    t = total + y
    compensation = (t - total) - y
    total = t
return total
```

## Usage Notes

- This function is particularly useful when summing a large number of floating-point values or when the values have widely different magnitudes, as these are scenarios where standard summation is prone to significant precision loss.
- The input `numbers` can be any iterable, such as a list, tuple, or generator.
- All elements within the iterable will be cast to `float` before being added.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single floating-point number representing the accurate sum.

## Example

The following example demonstrates a scenario where a naive summation fails due to floating-point limitations, but `pairwise_sum` produces the correct result.

```python
# Example usage with numbers of different magnitudes
data = [1e10, 1.0, -1e10]

# A naive sum might incorrectly evaluate to 0.0
# (1e10 + 1.0) can be rounded to 1e10, then subtracting 1e10 results in 0.0
naive_result = sum(data)
print(f"Naive sum result: {naive_result}")

# The pairwise_sum function correctly computes the sum
accurate_result = pairwise_sum(data)
print(f"Accurate sum result: {accurate_result}")
```

**Output:**

```
Naive sum result: 0.0
Accurate sum result: 1.0
```

## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
# Function: split_into_chunks(text: str, size: int)

## Overview

The `split_into_chunks` function divides a given string into a series of smaller, fixed-size substrings, returned as a tuple.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `text` | str | The input string that needs to be divided into chunks. |
| `size` | int | The desired maximum length for each chunk. This value must be a positive integer. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to segment a string into multiple parts of a specified length.

The function first validates the `size` parameter. If `size` is zero or a negative number, it raises a `ValueError`, as chunking a string into non-positive lengths is not a valid operation.

If the `size` is valid, the function proceeds to iterate through the input `text` using a generator expression. It uses `range(0, len(text), size)` to generate the starting indices for each chunk. For each starting index `i`, it slices the string from that index up to `i + size`. This process continues until the entire string has been processed. The resulting substrings are then collected into a tuple.

It is important to note that if the length of the input `text` is not perfectly divisible by `size`, the final chunk in the returned tuple will be shorter than the specified `size`.

```python
# The core logic uses a generator expression and tuple conversion
return tuple(text[i : i + size] for i in range(0, len(text), size))
```

## Usage Notes

- The `size` parameter must be a positive integer. Providing `0` or a negative integer will result in a `ValueError`.
- The function returns a `tuple` of strings, not a list.
- The last string in the returned tuple may have a length less than `size` if the total string length is not a multiple of `size`.

**Output Example**: A tuple containing string chunks.
`('chunk1', 'chunk2', 'rem')`

## Example

```python
# Example usage
long_string = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
chunk_size = 5

# Split the string into chunks of 5 characters
result = split_into_chunks(long_string, chunk_size)
print(result)

# Example with a string length that is a multiple of the chunk size
another_string = "1234567890"
result_even = split_into_chunks(another_string, 5)
print(result_even)
```

**Output:**

```
('abcde', 'fghij', 'klmno', 'pqrst', 'uvwxy', 'z')
('12345', '67890')
```
