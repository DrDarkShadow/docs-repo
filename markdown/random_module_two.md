## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
# Function: count_vowels(text: str)

## Overview

The `count_vowels` function counts the total number of vowels within a given string in a case-insensitive manner.

## Parameters

*   `text` (str): The input string in which to count vowels.

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to determine the vowel count in any given text.

The core logic begins by defining a `set` named `vowels` which contains all lowercase and uppercase English vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`). Using a `set` is highly efficient for membership testing, which is the primary operation performed.

The function then iterates through each character (`ch`) of the input `text` using a generator expression: `(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)`. For every character, it checks if the character exists within the `vowels` set. If a character is found in the set, the generator yields the number `1`.

Finally, the built-in `sum()` function is called on this generator. It consumes all the yielded `1`s and adds them together, producing the total count of vowels found in the string. This final sum is the integer value returned by the function.

```python
# Internal logic breakdown
vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
# For a text like "Hi", the generator would be (1 for 'H' if 'H' in vowels, 1 for 'i' if 'i' in vowels)
# This evaluates to a generator that yields just one value: 1
# sum() then calculates the total, which is 1.
```

## Usage Notes

- The function is case-insensitive. It will count both 'a' and 'A' as vowels.
- Characters that are not vowels, including consonants, numbers, whitespace, and symbols, are ignored.
- The letter 'y' is not considered a vowel by this function.

**Output Example**: The function returns an integer representing the total count of vowels. For the input `"Hello World"`, the return value would be `3`.

## Example

```python
# Example usage
input_string = "Programming is fun and rewarding!"
vowel_count = count_vowels(input_string)
print(f"The number of vowels in '{input_string}' is: {vowel_count}")
```

**Output:**

```
The number of vowels in 'Programming is fun and rewarding!' is: 8
```

## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
# Function: pairwise_sum(numbers: Iterable[float]) -> float

## Overview

The `pairwise_sum` function computes the sum of a sequence of numbers using a numerically stable algorithm to minimize floating-point errors.

## parameters

- **`numbers`** (`Iterable[float]`): An iterable (like a list, tuple, or generator) containing the numbers to be summed. The elements can be floats or integers, as they will be converted to floats.

## Description

This function provides a more precise method for summing floating-point numbers compared to a standard iterative addition. It implements the Kahan summation algorithm, which is designed to reduce the accumulation of rounding errors that can occur in floating-point arithmetic. This is especially important when summing many numbers or when the numbers vary greatly in magnitude.

The algorithm works by maintaining a running `compensation` variable that accumulates the error from each addition.

1.  The function initializes a `total` sum and a `compensation` value to `0.0`.
2.  It iterates through each `value` in the input `numbers`.
3.  For each `value`, it first creates a corrected value `y` by subtracting the `compensation` from the previous step. This reintroduces the "lost" part of the previous number into the current calculation.
    `y = float(value) - compensation`
4.  It then adds this corrected value `y` to the running `total`, storing it in a temporary variable `t`.
    `t = total + y`
5.  The core of the algorithm is calculating the new `compensation` value. This is the numerical error that occurred in the previous step. It's calculated as `(t - total) - y`. This isolates the low-order bits that were lost during the addition of `y` to `total`.
6.  The `total` is updated to the new sum `t`.
7.  This process repeats for all numbers, ensuring that the error from each step is carried over and corrected in the next, leading to a significantly more accurate final sum.

## Usage Notes

- This function is highly recommended over the standard `sum()` when precision is critical, such as in scientific, financial, or statistical computations.
- It is particularly effective when summing a large list of numbers or when adding very small numbers to a very large running total.
- The input iterable can contain integers; they will be automatically cast to `float` during the calculation.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single `float` value representing the precise sum.

```
1.0
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates the precision difference between Python's built-in `sum()` and `pairwise_sum` when summing a list of floating-point numbers that are subject to rounding errors.

```python
# A list where standard summation can introduce floating-point errors
data = [0.1] * 10  # Represents [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

# Using the built-in sum() function
standard_sum = sum(data)
print(f"Result with built-in sum(): {standard_sum}")

# Using the numerically stable pairwise_sum function
precise_sum = pairwise_sum(data)
print(f"Result with pairwise_sum(): {precise_sum}")
```

**Output:**

```
Result with built-in sum(): 0.9999999999999999
Result with pairwise_sum(): 1.0
```

## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
# Function: split_into_chunks(text: str, size: int)

## Overview

The `split_into_chunks` function divides a given string into a series of smaller, fixed-size substrings or "chunks".

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `text` | str | The input string that needs to be divided into chunks. |
| `size` | int | The desired maximum length for each chunk. This value must be a positive integer. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to segment a string into multiple parts of a specified length.

The function first validates the `size` parameter. If `size` is less than or equal to zero, it raises a `ValueError`, as chunking into non-positive lengths is not a valid operation.

If the `size` is valid, the function proceeds to iterate through the input `text`. It uses a `range` object that starts at index `0` and increments by the given `size` until it reaches the end of the string. In each iteration, it uses Python's string slicing `text[i : i + size]` to extract a substring of length `size`. These substrings are collected into a generator, which is then converted into a `tuple`.

If the length of the input `text` is not perfectly divisible by `size`, the final chunk in the resulting tuple will contain the remaining characters and will be shorter than the specified `size`.

```python
# The core logic uses a generator expression within a tuple constructor
# For text="abcdefg" and size=3, the range generates indices 0, 3, 6
# Slices will be text[0:3], text[3:6], text[6:9]
# This results in ('abc', 'def', 'g')
tuple(text[i : i + size] for i in range(0, len(text), size))
```

## Usage Notes

- The `size` parameter must be a positive integer (`> 0`). Providing `0` or a negative number will result in a `ValueError`.
- The function returns a `tuple` of strings. Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation.
- The last chunk in the returned tuple may be shorter than `size` if the total string length is not a multiple of `size`.

**Output Example**: A typical return value is a tuple of strings.

```
('chunk1', 'chunk2', 'chnk3')
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
long_string = "This is a sample string to demonstrate the chunking functionality."
chunk_size = 10

# Split the string into chunks of 10 characters
chunks = split_into_chunks(long_string, chunk_size)

print(chunks)
```

**Output:**

```
('This is a ', 'sample str', 'ing to dem', 'onstrate t', 'he chunkin', 'g function', 'ality.')
```
