## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
**count_vowels**: The function of count_vowels is to calculate the total number of vowels within a given string, treating uppercase and lowercase vowels the same.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 text: The input string to be scanned for vowels.

**Code Description**:
The function initializes a set named `vowels` containing all lowercase and uppercase English vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). It then iterates through each character (`ch`) of the input `text`. For each character, it checks if the character is present in the `vowels` set. A generator expression yields the number `1` for every character that is found in the set. Finally, the built-in `sum()` function calculates the total of all the generated `1`s, which corresponds to the total count of vowels, and returns this sum.

**Note**:
The check for vowels is case-insensitive because the `vowels` set explicitly includes both lowercase and uppercase vowel characters.

**Output Example**:
Calling `count_vowels("Hello World")` returns `3`.
## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
**pairwise_sum**: The function of pairwise_sum is to compute the arithmetic sum of an iterable of numbers using the Kahan summation algorithm for improved numerical precision.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 numbers: An iterable containing float or int values to be summed.

**Code Description**:
The function initializes two floating-point variables, `total` and `compensation`, to 0.0. It then iterates through each `value` in the input `numbers` iterable. Inside the loop, it first calculates a corrected value `y` by subtracting the `compensation` from the current `value`. A temporary sum `t` is computed by adding this corrected `y` to the running `total`. The `compensation` for the next iteration is then calculated by finding the difference `(t - total) - y`, which captures the numerical error from the addition. Finally, the `total` is updated to the value of `t`. After the loop has processed all numbers, the function returns the final `total`.

**Note**:
This function implements the Kahan summation algorithm, which is designed to minimize the accumulation of floating-point errors that can occur when summing a sequence of numbers. It is more numerically stable than a simple iterative sum, especially for datasets with a large range of values or many elements.

**Output Example**:
Calling `pairwise_sum([1.0, 1e100, 1.0, -1e100])` would return `2.0`.
## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
**split_into_chunks**: The function of split_into_chunks is to divide a string into a tuple of smaller, fixed-size substrings.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 text: The string to be split into chunks.
路 size: An integer representing the length of each chunk. This value must be positive.

**Code Description**:
The function first validates the `size` parameter. If `size` is less than or equal to zero, it raises a `ValueError`. If `size` is a positive number, the function proceeds to split the input `text`. It uses a generator expression that iterates through the `text` string with a step equal to `size`. In each step, it creates a slice of the string from the current index `i` up to `i + size`. The final slice may be shorter than `size` if the total length of the string is not perfectly divisible by `size`. All the generated string slices are collected into a tuple, which is then returned.

**Note**:
A `ValueError` will be raised if the `size` argument is not a positive integer. The last element in the returned tuple may have a length less than the specified `size`.

**Output Example**:
`('hel', 'lo ', 'wor', 'ld')`
