## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
# Function: count_vowels(text: str) -> int

## Overview

The `count_vowels` function calculates the total number of vowels present in a given input string, performing the count in a case-insensitive manner.

## Parameters

*   `text` (str): The input string in which to count the vowels.

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to determine the vowel count within a string. The core logic operates in two main steps:

1.  A `set` named `vowels` is initialized with all lowercase and uppercase English vowels (`a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U`). Using a set allows for highly efficient membership checking (i.e., checking if a character is a vowel).

2.  The function then iterates through each character (`ch`) of the input `text`. For each character, it checks if `ch` exists within the `vowels` set. A generator expression, `(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)`, yields a `1` for every character that is a vowel.

3.  The built-in `sum()` function is used to total all the `1`s produced by the generator, effectively counting the number of vowels. This final sum is then returned as an integer.

```python
# Internal logic breakdown
vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
# For text = "Test", the generator would be (1 for 'e' in vowels)
# sum() would then calculate the total, which is 1.
return sum(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)
```

## Usage Notes

- The function is case-insensitive. It will count both 'a' and 'A' as vowels.
- Only the standard English vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are considered. Characters like 'y' or accented vowels (e.g., 'Ã©') are not counted.
- The function expects a string as input. Providing a non-string type may result in a `TypeError`.

**Output Example**: The function returns an integer representing the total count of vowels.

```
5
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
input_sentence = "This is a Simple Test."
vowel_count = count_vowels(input_sentence)
print(f"The number of vowels is: {vowel_count}")
```

**Output:**

```
The number of vowels is: 6
```

## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
# Function: pairwise_sum(numbers: Iterable[float])

## Overview

The `pairwise_sum` function computes the sum of an iterable of numbers using the Kahan summation algorithm for enhanced numerical precision.

## parameters

*   `numbers`: `Iterable[float]` - Any iterable (e.g., list, tuple) containing float or integer values that need to be summed.

## Description

This function provides a numerically stable method for calculating the sum of a sequence of floating-point numbers. Standard summation, like Python's built-in `sum()`, can suffer from precision loss when adding numbers of vastly different magnitudes or when summing a large quantity of numbers. This is because adding a very small number to a very large number can cause the smaller number's contribution to be lost due to floating-point representation limits.

The `pairwise_sum` function mitigates this issue by implementing the Kahan summation algorithm. The algorithm works by maintaining a running `compensation` variable that accumulates the "lost" low-order bits from each addition.

The process is as follows:
1.  Initialize `total` and `compensation` to `0.0`.
2.  For each `value` in the input `numbers`:
    a. The `value` is corrected by subtracting the `compensation` from the previous step: `y = float(value) - compensation`.
    b. The corrected `y` is added to the running `total`: `t = total + y`.
    c. The error (or lost precision) from the addition is calculated and stored: `compensation = (t - total) - y`. This step is crucial; if the addition `total + y` were perfectly precise, `compensation` would be zero.
    d. The `total` is updated to the new sum `t`.
3.  This loop ensures that the error from one addition is carried over and incorporated into the next, preserving precision throughout the summation.

## Usage Notes

- This function is particularly useful in scientific, financial, or statistical computations where floating-point accuracy is critical.
- It provides a more precise result than the standard `sum()` function for floating-point numbers, especially with ill-conditioned datasets.
- The input `numbers` can be any iterable, including lists, tuples, or generators.
- All numbers in the iterable are cast to `float` internally before the summation begins.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single floating-point number representing the precise sum.

```
0.6
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates the higher precision of `pairwise_sum` compared to the standard `sum()` when dealing with numbers of very different magnitudes.

```python
# A list where small numbers are added to a large number, a classic case for precision loss.
numbers_to_sum = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 1e18, -1e18]

# Using the standard sum() function
standard_result = sum(numbers_to_sum)
print(f"Standard sum result: {standard_result}")

# Using the pairwise_sum function for better precision
precise_result = pairwise_sum(numbers_to_sum)
print(f"Pairwise sum result: {precise_result}")
```

**Output:**

```
Standard sum result: 0.6000000000000228
Pairwise sum result: 0.6
```

## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
# Function: split_into_chunks(text: str, size: int)

## Overview

The `split_into_chunks` function divides a given string into a series of smaller, fixed-size substrings, returned as a tuple.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `text` | `str` | The input string that needs to be divided into chunks. |
| `size` | `int` | The desired maximum length for each chunk. This value must be a positive integer. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to segment a string into multiple parts of a specified length.

The function first validates the `size` parameter. If `size` is less than or equal to zero, it raises a `ValueError`, as chunking into non-positive lengths is not a valid operation.

If the `size` is valid, the function proceeds to iterate through the input `text` using a generator expression. It uses `range(0, len(text), size)` to generate the starting indices for each chunk. For each starting index `i`, it creates a substring by slicing the `text` from `i` to `i + size`. Python's slicing mechanism automatically handles the final chunk, which will contain the remaining characters even if there are fewer than `size`.

Finally, all the generated string chunks are collected into a `tuple` and returned.

```python
# Internal logic for generating chunks
text = "abcdefg"
size = 3
# The range will produce indices 0, 3, 6
# The slices will be text[0:3], text[3:6], text[6:9]
# This results in ('abc', 'def', 'g')
chunks = tuple(text[i : i + size] for i in range(0, len(text), size))
```

## Usage Notes

- The `size` parameter must be a positive integer (`> 0`). Providing `0` or a negative number will result in a `ValueError`.
- The function returns a `tuple` of strings. If the input `text` is empty, an empty tuple `()` is returned.
- The last chunk in the returned tuple may be shorter than the specified `size` if the length of the input `text` is not perfectly divisible by `size`.

**Output Example**: A typical return value for a string "Hello World" with a chunk size of 4.

```
('Hell', 'o Wo', 'rld')
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
long_string = "This is a sample string to demonstrate the chunking functionality."
chunk_size = 10

# Split the string into chunks of 10 characters
result = split_into_chunks(long_string, chunk_size)
print(result)

# Example with a string length that is a multiple of the chunk size
another_string = "abcdefghij"
result_even = split_into_chunks(another_string, 5)
print(result_even)

# Example that would raise an error
try:
    split_into_chunks("some text", 0)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

**Output:**

```
('This is a ', 'sample str', 'ing to dem', 'onstrate t', 'he chunkin', 'g function', 'ality.')
('abcde', 'fghij')
size must be positive
```
