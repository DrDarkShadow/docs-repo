## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
The function of **count_vowels** is to calculate the total number of vowels within a given string, treating uppercase and lowercase vowels the same.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 `text`: The input string that will be scanned for vowels.

**Code Description**:
The function begins by defining a `set` named `vowels` which contains all lowercase and uppercase English vowels (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U). It then iterates through each character (`ch`) in the input `text`. For every character, it checks if the character is present in the `vowels` set. A generator expression yields the number `1` for each character that is found in the set. Finally, the built-in `sum()` function calculates the total of all the `1`s generated, effectively counting the vowels, and returns this sum.

**Note**:
The vowel check is case-insensitive because the `vowels` set explicitly includes both uppercase and lowercase letters. Using a set for vowel lookup is an efficient method for membership testing.

**Output Example**:
```python
# Calling count_vowels("Hello World")
10
```
## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
The function of **pairwise_sum** is to compute the arithmetic sum of an iterable of numbers using the Kahan summation algorithm for improved numerical precision.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 `numbers`: An iterable (e.g., a list or tuple) containing floating-point numbers or integers that will be summed.

**Code Description**:
The function initializes two floating-point variables: `total` to `0.0` to store the running sum, and `compensation` to `0.0` to accumulate rounding errors. It then iterates through each `value` in the input `numbers` iterable.

Inside the loop, for each value:
1. A corrected value `y` is calculated by subtracting the current `compensation` from the input `value` (which is first cast to a float).
2. A temporary sum `t` is computed by adding the current `total` to the corrected value `y`.
3. The `compensation` for the next iteration is recalculated. This new compensation value captures the numerical error (the low-order part) that was lost in the `t = total + y` operation.
4. The main `total` is updated with the value of the temporary sum `t`.

After the loop has processed all the numbers, the function returns the final `total`.

**Note**:
This function implements the Kahan summation algorithm, which is designed to minimize floating-point errors that can accumulate when summing a sequence of numbers. It is more numerically stable than a simple iterative addition, especially for datasets with a large number of values or values of widely varying magnitudes.

**Output Example**:
```python
# Calling the function with a list of floats
pairwise_sum([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5])
```
```
1.5
```
## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
The function of **split_into_chunks** is to divide a string into a tuple of smaller, fixed-size substrings.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 `text`: The string to be split into chunks.
路 `size`: The desired length for each chunk. This value must be a positive integer.

**Code Description**:
The function first checks if the provided `size` is a positive number. If `size` is less than or equal to zero, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "size must be positive". If the `size` is valid, the function uses a generator expression to iterate through the `text` string. The iteration starts at index 0 and advances by `size` steps until the end of the string is reached. In each step, it slices the `text` from the current index `i` to `i + size`, creating a chunk. Finally, all generated chunks are collected into a tuple and returned.

**Note**:
The last chunk in the returned tuple may be shorter than the specified `size` if the total length of the input `text` is not evenly divisible by `size`.

**Output Example**:
```python
('Hel', 'loW', 'orl', 'd')
```
