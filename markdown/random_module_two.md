## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
# Function: count_vowels(text: str)

## Overview

The `count_vowels` function counts the total number of vowels within a given string in a case-insensitive manner.

## Parameters

*   `text` (str): The input string to be scanned for vowels.

## Description

This function provides a simple way to determine the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in any given text.

The core logic begins by defining a `set` named `vowels` which contains both lowercase and uppercase versions of all five vowels: `aeiouAEIOU`. Using a set is highly efficient for checking if a character is a vowel, as membership tests are very fast.

The function then iterates through each character (`ch`) of the input `text`. For each character, it checks if `ch` is present in the `vowels` set. A generator expression, `(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)`, yields a `1` for every character that is a vowel. Finally, the built-in `sum()` function is used to add up all the `1`s, producing the total count of vowels. Characters that are not vowels (such as consonants, numbers, whitespace, or symbols) are ignored.

```python
# The function defines a set of all vowels for efficient, case-insensitive lookup.
vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")

# It then sums a generator expression that yields 1 for each character found in the vowels set.
return sum(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)
```

## Usage Notes

- The function is case-insensitive. It will count both 'a' and 'A' as vowels.
- Any characters that are not vowels, including consonants, numbers, punctuation, and whitespace, are ignored and not included in the count.
- The function returns an integer `0` if the input string is empty or contains no vowels.

**Output Example**: A possible return value for a given string.

```
7
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage of the count_vowels function

sample_text = "This is a Sample String with VOWELS and numbers 123!"
vowel_count = count_vowels(sample_text)

print(f"The string is: '{sample_text}'")
print(f"The number of vowels is: {vowel_count}")
```

**Output:**

```
The string is: 'This is a Sample String with VOWELS and numbers 123!'
The number of vowels is: 12
```

## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
# Function: pairwise_sum(numbers: Iterable[float])

## Overview

The `pairwise_sum` function computes the arithmetic sum of a sequence of numbers using a numerically stable algorithm to minimize floating-point errors.

## parameters

*   **`numbers`** (`Iterable[float]`): An iterable collection of numbers (e.g., a list, tuple, or generator) to be summed. Non-float values like integers will be converted to floats during the computation.

## Description

This function implements the Kahan summation algorithm, a technique designed to improve the precision of summing a sequence of floating-point numbers. Standard summation can suffer from significant round-off errors, especially when adding numbers of widely different magnitudes or when summing a very large quantity of numbers.

The algorithm maintains two key variables:
1.  `total`: The running sum, initialized to `0.0`.
2.  `compensation`: A variable to track the accumulated error (the "lost" low-order bits) from previous additions, also initialized to `0.0`.

For each `value` in the input `numbers`:
1.  The `value` is first cast to a float.
2.  A corrected value `y` is calculated by subtracting the `compensation` from the current `value`. This step reintroduces the error from the previous summation into the current calculation.
3.  A temporary sum `t` is computed by adding the corrected value `y` to the current `total`.
4.  The new `compensation` value is calculated as `(t - total) - y`. In perfect arithmetic, this would be zero. However, in floating-point arithmetic, `(t - total)` might not be exactly equal to `y`. This expression captures the round-off error that occurred when `y` was added to `total`.
5.  The `total` is updated to the new temporary sum `t`.

```python
# Inside the loop:
y = float(value) - compensation
t = total + y
compensation = (t - total) - y
total = t
```

After iterating through all numbers, the final `total` is returned, which is a more accurate representation of the true sum than what a simple `sum()` might produce.

## Usage Notes

- This function is particularly useful when high precision is required for summations, such as in scientific or financial calculations.
- It provides a more accurate result than Python's built-in `sum()` function when dealing with floating-point numbers that could lead to significant precision loss.
- The input `numbers` can be any iterable, including lists, tuples, and generators. This allows for memory-efficient processing of large datasets.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single floating-point number representing the sum. For an input of `[0.1] * 10`, the return value is `1.0`, whereas a standard sum might yield `0.9999999999999999`.

## Example

```python
# Example usage demonstrating precision improvement over standard sum.
# Summing a small fractional number multiple times can introduce errors.
data = [0.1] * 10

# Using pairwise_sum for better accuracy
accurate_result = pairwise_sum(data)
print(f"Result with pairwise_sum: {accurate_result}")

# Using standard built-in sum() for comparison
standard_result = sum(data)
print(f"Result with standard sum(): {standard_result}")
```

**Output:**

```
Result with pairwise_sum: 1.0
Result with standard sum(): 0.9999999999999999
```

## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
# Function: split_into_chunks(text: str, size: int)

## Overview

The `split_into_chunks` function divides a given string into a series of smaller, fixed-size substrings.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `text` | `str` | The input string that needs to be divided into chunks. |
| `size` | `int` | The desired maximum length for each chunk. This value must be a positive integer. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to segment a string into multiple parts of a specified length.

The function first validates the `size` parameter. If `size` is less than or equal to zero, it raises a `ValueError`, as chunking into non-positive lengths is not a valid operation.

If the `size` is valid, the function proceeds to split the `text`. It uses a generator expression that iterates through the input `text` with a step equal to the `size`. In each step, it slices the string from the current index `i` up to `i + size`. This creates a sequence of substrings. The final substring in the sequence may be shorter than `size` if the total length of the `text` is not perfectly divisible by `size`.

Finally, all the generated substrings are collected into a tuple, which is then returned.

```python
# The core logic uses a generator expression and range with a step
# For text="abcdefg" and size=3
# range(0, 7, 3) will produce indices 0, 3, 6
# Slices will be text[0:3], text[3:6], text[6:9]
# Resulting in "abc", "def", "g"
tuple(text[i : i + size] for i in range(0, len(text), size))
```

## Usage Notes

- The function will raise a `ValueError` if the `size` parameter is not a positive integer (i.e., if `size <= 0`).
- The returned value is a `tuple` of strings, which is an immutable sequence.
- The last chunk in the returned tuple may be shorter than the specified `size` if the length of the input `text` is not a multiple of `size`.
- If an empty string is passed as `text`, the function will return an empty tuple `()`.

**Output Example**: A tuple containing string chunks.

```
('This is a ', 'sample tex', 't.')
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
long_string = "This is a sample text for the chunking function."
chunk_size = 10

try:
    result = split_into_chunks(long_string, chunk_size)
    print(result)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

# Example with a string length that is a multiple of the chunk size
another_string = "1234567890"
result_even = split_into_chunks(another_string, 5)
print(result_even)
```

**Output:**

```
('This is a ', 'sample tex', 't for the ', 'chunking f', 'unction.')
('12345', '67890')
```
