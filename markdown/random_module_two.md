## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
# Function: count_vowels(text: str)

## Overview

The `count_vowels` function counts the total number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) within a given string, ignoring case.

## parameters

- `text`: `str` - The input string to be scanned for vowels.

## Description

This function provides an efficient way to determine the number of vowels in a text string.

The core logic begins by defining a `set` named `vowels` containing both lowercase and uppercase vowels (`"aeiouAEIOU"`). Using a set is highly efficient for membership testing, as it provides an average time complexity of O(1) for checking if a character exists within it.

The function then employs a generator expression, `(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)`, to iterate through each character (`ch`) of the input `text`. For each character, it checks if `ch` is present in the `vowels` set. If it is, the generator yields the number `1`.

Finally, the built-in `sum()` function is called on this generator. It consumes all the yielded `1`s and adds them together, producing a final integer count of all the vowels found in the string. This sum is then returned as the result.

```python
# Internal logic breakdown
vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
# For an input "Hello", the generator would yield 1 for 'e' and 1 for 'o'.
# sum() would then calculate 1 + 1 = 2.
return sum(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)
```

## Usage Notes

- **Case-Insensitive**: The function is case-insensitive by design, meaning it will count both 'a' and 'A' as vowels.
- **Non-Vowel Characters**: Any characters that are not vowels, including consonants, numbers, spaces, and punctuation, are ignored and not included in the count.
- **Return Value**: The function always returns an integer (`int`). If the input string contains no vowels or is empty, it will return `0`.

**Output Example**:
A possible return value for a given string.
```
5
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
input_sentence = "This is a simple Test Sentence."
vowel_count = count_vowels(input_sentence)
print(f"The input sentence is: '{input_sentence}'")
print(f"The number of vowels is: {vowel_count}")
```

**Output:**

```
The input sentence is: 'This is a simple Test Sentence.'
The number of vowels is: 8
```

## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
# Function: pairwise_sum

## Overview

The `pairwise_sum` function computes the arithmetic sum of an iterable of numbers using the Kahan summation algorithm to provide a more numerically stable and precise result.

## parameters

- `numbers` (Iterable[float]): An iterable collection of numbers, such as a list or tuple of floats or integers, that will be summed.

## Description

This function provides a robust method for summing floating-point numbers, significantly reducing the numerical error that can accumulate with standard summation methods. Standard addition of floating-point numbers can lead to a loss of precision, especially when adding a very small number to a very large one.

The `pairwise_sum` function implements the Kahan summation algorithm to counteract this issue. It maintains a running `compensation` variable to account for the low-order bits that are typically lost during addition.

The process for each `value` in the input `numbers` is as follows:
1.  The `value` is first corrected by subtracting the `compensation` from the previous iteration. This corrected value is stored in `y`.
2.  The corrected value `y` is added to the running `total`. This operation may still result in some precision loss.
3.  The error from the addition in the previous step is calculated as `(t - total) - y` and stored in the `compensation` variable for the next iteration.
4.  The `total` is updated with the new sum `t`.

By repeatedly carrying over the "lost" part of the sum, the algorithm ensures that the final `total` is much more accurate than a naive summation.

```python
# Inside the function
total = 0.0
compensation = 0.0
for value in numbers:
    y = float(value) - compensation  # Correct the value
    t = total + y                    # Add to the running total
    compensation = (t - total) - y   # Calculate the error (what was lost)
    total = t                        # Update the total
```

## Usage Notes

- This function is particularly useful when summing a large set of floating-point numbers or when the numbers have widely different magnitudes, as it minimizes cumulative floating-point errors.
- It is more accurate than Python's built-in `sum()` for floating-point arithmetic under such conditions.
- The input `numbers` must be an iterable.
- Any integers in the input iterable will be automatically cast to floats during the computation.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single floating-point number representing the accurate sum.

## Example

```python
# A standard sum can lose precision when adding very small numbers to a large one.
# The small numbers get rounded away.
data = [1.0] + [1e-16] * 1000000

# Using the built-in sum()
naive_sum = sum(data)
print(f"Naive Sum: {naive_sum}")

# Using pairwise_sum for better precision
accurate_sum = pairwise_sum(data)
print(f"Pairwise (Kahan) Sum: {accurate_sum}")
```

**Output:**

```
Naive Sum: 1.0
Pairwise (Kahan) Sum: 1.0000000000001
```

## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
# Function: split_into_chunks(text: str, size: int)

## Overview

The `split_into_chunks` function divides a given string into a series of smaller, fixed-size substrings, returned as a tuple.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `text` | `str` | The input string that needs to be divided into chunks. |
| `size` | `int` | The desired maximum length for each chunk. This value must be a positive integer. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to segment a string into multiple parts of a specified length.

The function first validates the `size` parameter. If `size` is less than or equal to zero, it raises a `ValueError`, as chunking is not possible with a non-positive length.

The core logic uses a generator expression with `range()` to iterate through the input `text`. The `range` is configured to start at index `0`, end at the length of the string (`len(text)`), and step by the given `size`. This process generates the starting index `i` for each chunk.

For each starting index `i`, a slice of the string `text[i : i + size]` is created. This slice represents one chunk. Because the slicing operation handles boundaries gracefully, the final chunk will automatically be shorter than `size` if the total string length is not evenly divisible by `size`.

Finally, all the generated chunks are collected into a `tuple` and returned.

```python
# The core logic is equivalent to this generator expression
(text[i : i + size] for i in range(0, len(text), size))
```

## Usage Notes

- The `size` parameter must be a positive integer. Providing `0` or a negative number will result in a `ValueError`.
- The last chunk in the returned tuple may be shorter than the specified `size` if the length of the input `text` is not a multiple of `size`.
- If the input `text` is an empty string, the function will return an empty tuple `()`.
- The function always returns a `tuple` of strings.

**Output Example**: A typical return value for a string "hello world" with a size of 4 would look like this:
`('hell', 'o wo', 'rld')`

## Example

```python
# Example usage
long_string = "This is a sample string to demonstrate the chunking functionality."
chunk_size = 10

# Split the string into chunks of 10 characters
chunks = split_into_chunks(long_string, chunk_size)
print(chunks)

# Example with a string length not divisible by the chunk size
short_string = "abcdefgh"
short_chunk_size = 3
short_chunks = split_into_chunks(short_string, short_chunk_size)
print(short_chunks)
```

**Output:**

```
('This is a ', 'sample str', 'ing to dem', 'onstrate t', 'he chunkin', 'g function', 'ality.')
('abc', 'def', 'gh')
```
