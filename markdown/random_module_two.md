## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
# Function: count_vowels(text: str)

## Overview

The `count_vowels` function counts the total number of vowels within a given string in a case-insensitive manner.

## parameters

- `text` (str): The input string to be scanned for vowels.

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to determine the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in any given text.

The core logic operates in two main steps:
1.  A `set` named `vowels` is initialized with both lowercase and uppercase vowels: `set("aeiouAEIOU")`. Using a set allows for highly efficient, constant-time lookups (average O(1)) to check if a character is a vowel.
2.  The function then iterates through each character (`ch`) in the input `text`. It uses a generator expression `(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)` which yields the number `1` for every character that is found within the `vowels` set.
3.  Finally, the built-in `sum()` function is used to add up all the `1`s produced by the generator, resulting in the total count of vowels.

```python
# Internal logic breakdown
vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
# For a text "Example", the generator would yield 1 for 'E', 1 for 'a', and 1 for 'e'.
# sum() would then calculate 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
return sum(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)
```

## Usage Notes

- The function is case-insensitive. It will correctly count both 'a' and 'A' as vowels.
- Characters that are not vowels, such as consonants, numbers, whitespace, and symbols, are ignored and not included in the count.
- The function returns an integer `0` if the input string is empty or contains no vowels.

**Output Example**: A non-negative integer representing the total vowel count.

## Example

```python
# Example usage
sample_string = "This is a Test String for Counting Vowels!"
vowel_count = count_vowels(sample_string)
print(f"The string is: '{sample_string}'")
print(f"The number of vowels is: {vowel_count}")
```

**Output:**

```
The string is: 'This is a Test String for Counting Vowels!'
The number of vowels is: 11
```

## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
# Function: pairwise_sum

## Overview

The `pairwise_sum` function computes the arithmetic sum of an iterable of numbers using the Kahan summation algorithm to maintain high numerical precision.

## parameters

- **numbers** (`Iterable[float]`): An iterable (like a list, tuple, or generator) containing the numbers to be summed. The function can handle both floats and integers, as it internally casts all values to `float`.

## Description

This function provides a numerically stable method for summing a sequence of floating-point numbers. Standard summation, like `total += value`, can suffer from precision loss, especially when adding numbers of vastly different magnitudes or when summing a large quantity of numbers. This is because the lower-order bits of smaller numbers can be lost when they are added to a much larger running total.

The `pairwise_sum` function implements the Kahan summation algorithm to mitigate this issue. It works by maintaining a separate variable, `compensation`, to accumulate the round-off error from each addition.

The logic proceeds as follows for each `value` in the input `numbers`:
1.  `y = float(value) - compensation`: The error from the previous addition (`compensation`) is subtracted from the current `value`. This creates a corrected value `y`.
2.  `t = total + y`: The corrected value `y` is added to the running `total`. This addition may still introduce a small floating-point error.
3.  `compensation = (t - total) - y`: This is the core of the algorithm. It calculates the new round-off error. In an ideal scenario, `(t - total)` would be exactly equal to `y`, making `compensation` zero. However, due to floating-point limitations, `(t - total)` is what was *actually* added. The difference between what was actually added and what was *intended* to be added (`y`) is the new error, which is stored in `compensation`.
4.  `total = t`: The running total is updated.

By carrying the "lost" part of the sum from one iteration to the next, the algorithm ensures that the final `total` is significantly more accurate than a naive summation.

## Usage Notes

- This function is more computationally intensive than Python's built-in `sum()`. It is best used in scenarios where numerical precision is critical, such as in scientific or financial calculations involving a wide range of number magnitudes.
- The function internally casts all input values to `float`, so an iterable containing integers or a mix of integers and floats is acceptable.
- For maximum precision with floating-point numbers in Python, consider also `math.fsum()`, which implements a similar algorithm.

**Output Example**:
The function returns a single floating-point number representing the accurate sum.
```
6.14
```

## Example

```python
# Example demonstrating precision with large and small numbers
# A naive sum might lose precision when the small numbers are added to the large one.
numbers_to_sum = [1e10, 1, -1e10, 2, 3.14]

# Using the pairwise_sum function
accurate_sum = pairwise_sum(numbers_to_sum)
print(f"Accurate sum: {accurate_sum}")

# For comparison, a naive sum
naive_sum = sum(numbers_to_sum)
print(f"Naive sum: {naive_sum}")
```

**Output:**

```
Accurate sum: 6.14
Naive sum: 6.140000000000114
```

## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
# Function: split_into_chunks(text: str, size: int)

## Overview

The `split_into_chunks` function divides a given string into a series of smaller, fixed-size substrings.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `text` | str | The input string that needs to be divided into chunks. |
| `size` | int | The desired length for each chunk. This value must be a positive integer. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to segment a string into multiple parts of a specified length.

The function first validates the `size` parameter. If `size` is zero or a negative number, it raises a `ValueError` because a chunk length must be a positive value.

If the `size` is valid, the function proceeds to iterate through the input `text` using a generator expression. It generates start indices for each chunk by using `range(0, len(text), size)`, which creates a sequence of numbers starting from `0` up to the length of the text, incrementing by the `size` value at each step.

For each start index `i`, a substring is extracted from the `text` using a slice: `text[i : i + size]`. This slice creates a chunk of length `size`. If the remaining part of the string is shorter than `size`, the final slice will simply include all remaining characters, resulting in a final chunk that is shorter than the specified `size`.

Finally, all the generated chunks are collected into a tuple and returned.

```python
# The core logic uses a generator expression and tuple conversion
tuple(text[i : i + size] for i in range(0, len(text), size))
```

## Usage Notes

- The `size` parameter must be a positive integer. Providing `0` or a negative integer will result in a `ValueError`.
- The function returns a `tuple` of strings, not a list.
- The last chunk in the returned tuple may be shorter than the specified `size` if the total length of the input `text` is not an even multiple of `size`.

**Output Example**: A possible return value for a string of length 25 and a chunk size of 10.

```
('0123456789', '0123456789', '01234')
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
long_string = "This is a sample string for demonstrating the chunking function."
chunk_size = 10

# Split the string into chunks of 10 characters
chunks = split_into_chunks(long_string, chunk_size)
print(chunks)
```

**Output:**

```
('This is a ', 'sample str', 'ing for de', 'monstratin', 'g the chun', 'king funct', 'ion.')
```
