## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
**count_vowels**: The function of count_vowels is to calculate the total number of vowels within a given string in a case-insensitive manner.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 text: The input string that will be scanned for vowels.

**Code Description**:
The function begins by defining a set named `vowels` which contains all lowercase and uppercase English vowels (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U). It then uses a generator expression to iterate through each character (`ch`) in the input `text`. For every character, it checks if that character is present in the `vowels` set. If a character is found in the set, the generator yields the number 1. Finally, the built-in `sum()` function is used to add up all the 1s produced by the generator, effectively counting the total number of vowels. This final sum is then returned.

**Note**:
The function performs a case-insensitive count because the `vowels` set explicitly includes both uppercase and lowercase vowel characters. Using a set for vowel lookup provides efficient character checking.

**Output Example**:
Calling `count_vowels("Hello World")` returns `3`.
## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
**pairwise_sum**: The function of pairwise_sum is to compute the sum of an iterable of numbers using the Kahan summation algorithm for improved numerical precision.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 numbers: An iterable containing float or int values to be summed.

**Code Description**:
The function initializes two floating-point variables, `total` and `compensation`, to 0.0. It then iterates through each `value` in the input `numbers` iterable. Inside the loop, it first calculates a corrected value `y` by subtracting the `compensation` from the current `value`. This `compensation` term carries the error from the previous iteration's summation. Next, it calculates a temporary sum `t` by adding the corrected value `y` to the running `total`. The `compensation` for the next iteration is then calculated by finding the difference between the new sum `t` and the original `total`, and then subtracting `y`. This step effectively isolates the numerical error introduced by the addition. Finally, the `total` is updated to the value of `t`. After the loop has processed all values, the function returns the final `total`.

**Note**:
This function implements the Kahan summation algorithm, which is designed to reduce the accumulation of floating-point errors that can occur when summing a sequence of numbers. It is more numerically stable than a simple iterative sum, especially for datasets with a large range of values or many elements.

**Output Example**:
Calling `pairwise_sum([1e10, 1.0, -1e10])` would return `1.0`.
## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
**split_into_chunks**: The function of split_into_chunks is to split a given string into a tuple of smaller, fixed-size substrings.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
路 text: The string to be split into chunks.
路 size: The integer length for each chunk. This value must be positive.

**Code Description**:
The function first checks if the provided `size` is a positive number. If `size` is less than or equal to 0, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "size must be positive". If the `size` is valid, the function proceeds to slice the input `text`. It uses a generator expression that iterates through the `text` with a step equal to `size`, creating substrings from the current index `i` up to `i + size`. These substrings are then collected into a tuple and returned. The final substring in the tuple may be shorter than the specified `size` if the length of the input `text` is not perfectly divisible by `size`.

**Note**:
A `ValueError` will be raised if the `size` argument is not a positive integer. The last chunk in the output tuple can be shorter than the specified `size`.

**Output Example**:
`('abc', 'def', 'g')`
