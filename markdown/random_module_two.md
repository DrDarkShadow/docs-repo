## FunctionDef choose_random_item
# Function: choose_random_item(items: List[str])

## Overview

The `choose_random_item` function selects and returns a single random item from a given list of strings.

## parameters

- **`items`** (`List[str]`): A list of strings to choose from. This list must not be empty.

## Description

This function provides a safe way to select a random element from a list of strings. The core logic involves two main steps:

1.  **Validation**: The function first checks if the provided `items` list is empty using the condition `if not items:`. This is a crucial safeguard to prevent errors in the subsequent steps. If the list is empty, the function raises a `ValueError` with the message "items must not be empty", immediately halting execution and informing the user of the invalid input.

2.  **Random Selection**: If the list is not empty, the function proceeds to use the `random.choice(items)` method. This method, from Python's standard `random` library, takes a non-empty sequence as input and returns a single element chosen uniformly at random. This means every item in the `items` list has an equal probability of being selected.

The randomly selected string is then returned as the result of the function.

```python
# Internal logic example
import random
from typing import List

def choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str:
    # Step 1: Validate that the list is not empty
    if not items:
        raise ValueError("items must not be empty")
    # Step 2: Return a single random item from the list
    return random.choice(items)
```

## Usage Notes

- The input list `items` must not be empty. Providing an empty list will result in a `ValueError`.
- This function depends on Python's built-in `random` module. Ensure it is imported in the environment where this function is used (e.g., `import random`).
- The selection is uniformly random, meaning each item in the list has an equal chance of being chosen on any given call.

**Output Example**: A single string element from the input list. For an input of `["red", "green", "blue"]`, a possible return value is `"green"`.

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

# Definition of the function
def choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str:
    """Choose a single random item from a non-empty sequence."""
    if not items:
        raise ValueError("items must not be empty")
    return random.choice(items)

# Example usage
colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"]
random_color = choose_random_item(colors)
print(f"The randomly chosen color is: {random_color}")

# Example of error handling
try:
    empty_list = []
    choose_random_item(empty_list)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error caught: {e}")
```

**Output:**

```
The randomly chosen color is: blue
Error caught: items must not be empty
```
*(Note: The chosen color in the first line of the output will vary with each execution, as it is selected randomly.)*

### FunctionDef choose_random_item
# Function: choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str

## Overview

The `choose_random_item` function randomly selects and returns a single string element from a given list of strings.

## parameters

- `items`: `List[str]` - A list of strings from which one item will be randomly chosen.

## Description

This function is designed to perform a random selection from a collection of items. It accepts a single argument, `items`, which is expected to be a list of strings.

Internally, the function utilizes a random selection algorithm to pick one element from the input `items` list. The most common implementation in Python would involve using the `random.choice()` method from the standard `random` library, which is purpose-built for this task. After selecting an item, the function returns it as a string.

A typical implementation would look like this:

```python
import random
from typing import List

def choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str:
    # Ensure the list is not empty to avoid errors
    if not items:
        raise ValueError("The input list cannot be empty.")
    
    # Choose and return a random item from the list
    return random.choice(items)
```

## Usage Notes

- The input list `items` must not be empty. Passing an empty list will result in a `ValueError` or `IndexError`, depending on the implementation.
- The function is non-deterministic. Calling it multiple times with the same list will likely produce different results.
- As per the type hint `List[str]`, the function is specifically designed to work with lists of strings.

## Example

```python
# Example usage
# Note: You would need to import the 'random' module for a working implementation.
import random

# A sample implementation for demonstration
def choose_random_item(items: list) -> str:
    if not items:
        return "List is empty"
    return random.choice(items)

available_colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow", "Purple"]
selected_color = choose_random_item(available_colors)
print(f"The randomly selected color is: {selected_color}")
```

**Output:**

```
The randomly selected color is: Blue
```
(Note: The actual output will be a randomly selected item from the `available_colors` list and may differ on each execution.)

## FunctionDef shuffle_copy
# Function: shuffle_copy(items: List[int])

## Overview

The `shuffle_copy` function returns a new, randomly shuffled copy of a given list without altering the original list.

## parameters

*   `items` (`List[int]`): A list of integers that will be copied and shuffled.

## Description

This function provides a safe way to shuffle a list by ensuring the original data structure remains untouched. The process is executed in three main steps:

1.  A shallow copy of the input `items` list is created using `list(items)`. This new list is stored in a variable named `copy`. This step is crucial for preventing mutation of the original list passed to the function.
2.  The `random.shuffle()` method is then called on the `copy`. This function shuffles the elements of the `copy` list in-place, rearranging them into a random order.
3.  Finally, the function returns the modified `copy`, which now holds the same elements as the original list but in a new, randomized sequence.

```python
# Internal logic
copy = list(items)
random.shuffle(copy)
return copy
```

## Usage Notes

- This function is non-mutating, meaning the original list you pass as an argument will not be changed.
- The function relies on Python's built-in `random` module. Ensure this module is imported in your script before calling the function.
- Due to the nature of random shuffling, calling the function multiple times with the same input list will likely produce a different-ordered list each time.

**Output Example**: A possible return value for an input of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

```
[4, 1, 5, 2, 3]
```

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

# The function must be defined or imported
def shuffle_copy(items: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Return a shuffled copy of the given list without mutating the input."""
    copy = list(items)
    random.shuffle(copy)
    return copy

# Example usage
original_numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
shuffled_numbers = shuffle_copy(original_numbers)

print(f"Original List (unchanged): {original_numbers}")
print(f"Shuffled Copy: {shuffled_numbers}")
```

**Output:**

```
Original List (unchanged): [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Shuffled Copy: [30, 50, 10, 20, 40]
```
*(Note: The actual order of elements in the "Shuffled Copy" will vary with each execution.)*

***
### FunctionDef shuffle_copy
# Function: shuffle_copy(items: List[int])

## Overview

The `shuffle_copy` function creates a shuffled copy of a list of integers, leaving the original list unchanged.

## parameters

- `items`: `List[int]` - The input list of integers to be copied and shuffled.

## Description

This function provides a non-destructive way to shuffle a list. It operates by first creating a shallow copy of the input `items` list. This initial step is crucial as it ensures that the original list passed to the function is not altered.

After creating the copy, the function shuffles the elements of the new list in-place, rearranging them into a random order. Finally, it returns this newly created and shuffled list. The original `items` list remains in its initial order.

```python
import random

def shuffle_copy(items: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Creates a shuffled copy of a list.
    """
    items_copy = items.copy()
    random.shuffle(items_copy)
    return items_copy
```

## Usage Notes

- This function does not modify the original list. It returns a new, shuffled list.
- The shuffling is pseudo-random. For reproducible results, you can seed Python's random number generator using `random.seed()` before calling this function.
- Although the type hint specifies `List[int]`, the underlying logic works with lists containing elements of any type.

## Example

```python
# Example usage
import random

# For reproducible results in this example
random.seed(42)

original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
shuffled_list = shuffle_copy(original_list)

print("Original List:", original_list)
print("Shuffled Copy:", shuffled_list)

```

**Output:**

```
Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Shuffled Copy: [1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 5]
```
