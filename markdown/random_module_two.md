## FunctionDef count_vowels(text)
# Function: count_vowels

## Overview

The `count_vowels` function counts the total number of vowels within a given string in a case-insensitive manner.

## parameters

- `text` (str): The input string to be scanned for vowels.

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to determine the number of vowels in a string. The core logic operates as follows:

1.  A `set` named `vowels` is initialized with all lowercase and uppercase English vowels (`"aeiouAEIOU"`). Using a set allows for highly efficient, constant-time average complexity (`O(1)`) checks to see if a character is a vowel.

2.  The function then iterates through each character (`ch`) in the input `text`.

3.  For each character, it checks if `ch` is present in the `vowels` set.

4.  A generator expression, `(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)`, yields the number `1` for every character that is found in the `vowels` set.

5.  Finally, the built-in `sum()` function is used to add up all the `1`s produced by the generator, resulting in the total count of vowels in the string.

```python
# Internal logic breakdown
vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
# For an input "Hello", the generator would yield 1 for 'e' and 1 for 'o'.
# sum() would then calculate 1 + 1 = 2.
return sum(1 for ch in text if ch in vowels)
```

## Usage Notes

- The vowel count is case-insensitive. For example, 'A' and 'a' are both counted as vowels.
- The function only considers the five standard English vowels: a, e, i, o, u.
- Characters that are not vowels, including consonants, numbers, whitespace, and symbols, are ignored and not included in the count.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single integer representing the total number of vowels found.

## Example

```python
# Example usage
input_string = "Hello World! This is a test."
vowel_count = count_vowels(input_string)
print(f"The input string is: '{input_string}'")
print(f"The number of vowels is: {vowel_count}")
```

**Output:**

```
The input string is: 'Hello World! This is a test.'
The number of vowels is: 7
```

## FunctionDef pairwise_sum(numbers)
# Function: pairwise_sum

## Overview

The `pairwise_sum` function computes the arithmetic sum of an iterable of numbers using the Kahan summation algorithm to ensure high numerical precision.

## parameters

- **`numbers`**: `Iterable[float]`
  - An iterable collection of numbers (e.g., a list, tuple) containing floats or integers. Each element will be converted to a float before summation.

## Description

This function provides a numerically stable method for summing floating-point numbers, which is crucial for avoiding precision errors that can occur with standard summation, especially when dealing with a large set of numbers or numbers of widely varying magnitudes.

Instead of a simple iterative addition, the function implements the Kahan summation algorithm. This algorithm maintains a running `compensation` variable to correct for the low-order bits that are lost during each addition step.

The logic proceeds as follows:
1.  A `total` sum and a `compensation` value are initialized to `0.0`.
2.  The function iterates through each `value` in the input `numbers`.
3.  For each `value`, it is first corrected by subtracting the `compensation` from the previous iteration. This corrected value is stored in `y`.
4.  A temporary sum `t` is calculated by adding the current `total` and the corrected value `y`.
5.  The core of the algorithm is calculating the next `compensation`. This is done by evaluating `(t - total) - y`. In perfect arithmetic, this would be zero. However, in floating-point arithmetic, this expression captures the round-off error from the addition `total + y`.
6.  The main `total` is updated with the value of `t`.

By repeatedly carrying over the round-off error into the next iteration, the algorithm minimizes cumulative error, yielding a final sum that is significantly more accurate than a naive summation.

```python
# Kahan summation for improved precision
total = 0.0
compensation = 0.0
for value in numbers:
    y = float(value) - compensation
    t = total + y
    compensation = (t - total) - y
    total = t
```

## Usage Notes

- This function is more computationally intensive than the built-in `sum()` function but provides higher accuracy. It is recommended for scientific and financial calculations where precision is critical.
- It is particularly effective when summing a long series of numbers or when the numbers have very different magnitudes (e.g., adding a very small number to a very large one repeatedly).
- The function internally converts all input numbers to `float`, so an iterable of integers is also a valid input.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single floating-point number representing the accurate sum.

```
1000.0
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates the precision advantage of `pairwise_sum` over the standard built-in `sum()`. Adding `0.1` ten times with standard floating-point arithmetic results in a small precision error, which `pairwise_sum` corrects.

```python
# A list where standard summation can introduce floating-point errors
numbers_to_sum = [0.1] * 10

# Using the standard sum() function
standard_sum = sum(numbers_to_sum)
print(f"Standard sum: {standard_sum}")

# Using the numerically stable pairwise_sum function
stable_sum = pairwise_sum(numbers_to_sum)
print(f"Pairwise (Kahan) sum: {stable_sum}")
```

**Output:**

```
Standard sum: 0.9999999999999999
Pairwise (Kahan) sum: 1.0
```

## FunctionDef split_into_chunks(text, size)
# Function: split_into_chunks

## Overview

The `split_into_chunks` function divides a given string into a series of smaller, fixed-size substrings.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `text` | `str` | The input string that needs to be split into chunks. |
| `size` | `int` | The desired length for each chunk. This value must be a positive integer. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to segment a string into multiple parts of a specified length.

The function first validates the `size` parameter. If `size` is zero or a negative number, it raises a `ValueError` because a chunk length must be a positive value.

If the `size` is valid, the function proceeds to slice the string. It uses a generator expression combined with the `range()` function to iterate through the input `text`. The `range()` function is configured with a step equal to `size`, which effectively creates the starting index for each new chunk (`0`, `size`, `2*size`, etc.).

For each starting index `i`, a slice `text[i : i + size]` is taken. This slice extracts a substring of length `size`. If the final slice extends beyond the end of the string, Python's slicing mechanism automatically handles this by taking all characters until the end. This results in the last chunk potentially being shorter than the specified `size`.

Finally, all generated chunks are collected into a `tuple` which is then returned.

```python
# Internal logic breakdown
def split_into_chunks(text: str, size: int) -> Tuple[str, ...]:
    # 1. Validate the size parameter
    if size <= 0:
        raise ValueError("size must be positive")
    
    # 2. Generate chunks using a generator expression and string slicing
    # The range function creates indices: 0, size, 2*size, ...
    # The slice text[i : i + size] extracts each chunk
    chunks_generator = (text[i : i + size] for i in range(0, len(text), size))
    
    # 3. Convert the generator to a tuple and return
    return tuple(chunks_generator)
```

## Usage Notes

- The `size` parameter must be a positive integer. Providing `0` or a negative integer will result in a `ValueError`.
- The function returns a `tuple` of strings.
- The last string in the returned tuple may be shorter than `size` if the total length of the input `text` is not a multiple of `size`.

**Output Example**: A tuple containing string chunks.

```
('chunk1', 'chunk2', 'chu')
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
my_text = "This is a sample text to be split."
chunk_size = 10
result = split_into_chunks(my_text, chunk_size)
print(result)

# Example with a string length not divisible by chunk size
another_text = "abcdefghij"
short_chunk_size = 3
result_short = split_into_chunks(another_text, short_chunk_size)
print(result_short)
```

**Output:**

```
('This is a ', 'sample tex', 't to be sp', 'lit.')
('abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'j')
```
