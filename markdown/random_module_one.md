## FunctionDef num(a, b)
# Function: def num(a, b)

## Overview

The `num` function calculates and returns the sum of two provided arguments.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `a` | int / float | The first operand for the addition operation. |
| `b` | int / float | The second operand for the addition operation. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to perform addition. It accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numerical values (integers or floating-point numbers). The core logic of the function is the expression `a + b`, which computes the sum of the two inputs. The resulting value is then returned by the function.

Due to Python's dynamic typing, the `+` operator can also perform concatenation if strings are passed as arguments. However, the function's name `num` implies its primary purpose is for numerical calculations.

```python
# The function adds the two parameters and returns the result.
return a + b
```

## Usage Notes

- The function will work with any data types that support the addition (`+`) operator, such as integers, floats, and strings.
- If you provide incompatible types (e.g., an integer and a string), the function will raise a `TypeError`.
- When used with strings, the function will perform concatenation, not mathematical addition.

**Output Example**: If the inputs are `5` and `10`, the function returns an integer.

```
15
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage with integers
result_int = num(10, 5)
print(result_int)

# Example usage with floats
result_float = num(7.5, 2.5)
print(result_float)
```

**Output:**

```
15
10.0
```

## FunctionDef generate_random_integers(count, start, end)
# Function: generate_random_integers(count: int, start: int = 0, end: int = 100) -> List[int]

## Overview

The `generate_random_integers` function returns a list of a specified number of pseudo-random integers within a given inclusive range.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `count` | `int` | The total number of integers to generate in the list. |
| `start` | `int` | The inclusive lower bound for the random values. Defaults to `0`. |
| `end` | `int` | The inclusive upper bound for the random values. Defaults to `100`. |

## Description

This function provides a convenient way to generate a list of random integers. It begins by validating its input parameters to ensure logical consistency.

First, it checks if the `count` parameter is a negative number. If `count` is less than zero, it is impossible to create a list of that size, so the function raises a `ValueError`.

Next, it ensures that the range `[start, end]` is correctly ordered. If the provided `start` value is greater than the `end` value, the function automatically swaps them. This makes the function more robust, as the user does not need to worry about the order of these two parameters.

Finally, the function uses a list comprehension in conjunction with the `random.randint(start, end)` method. It iterates `count` times, and in each iteration, it generates a single random integer that is uniformly sampled from the inclusive range `[start, end]`. These integers are collected into a list, which is the final return value.

```python
# Internal logic for generating 5 numbers between 1 and 10
import random
start, end = 1, 10
count = 5
# The list comprehension is equivalent to this loop:
result_list = []
for _ in range(count):
    random_number = random.randint(start, end)
    result_list.append(random_number)
# result_list is then returned
```

## Usage Notes

- This function requires the `random` module to be imported.
- The `count` parameter must be a non-negative integer. Providing a negative value will result in a `ValueError`.
- If the `start` value is greater than the `end` value, the function will swap them internally; you do not need to handle this case yourself.
- The range defined by `start` and `end` is inclusive, meaning both `start` and `end` are possible values in the output list.

**Output Example**: A list of integers.

```
[42, 8, 99, 54, 23]
```

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

# Example usage: Generate 5 random integers between 10 and 50.
random_numbers = generate_random_integers(5, 10, 50)
print(random_numbers)
```

**Output:**

```
[43, 15, 22, 49, 37]
```

## FunctionDef fibonacci(n)
# Function: fibonacci(n: int)

## Overview

The `fibonacci` function computes the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach.

## parameters

- `n` (int): The 0-indexed position of the desired Fibonacci number in the sequence.

## Description

This function calculates the nth Fibonacci number, where the sequence starts with F₀ = 0 and F₁ = 1.

The function begins by validating the input `n`. If `n` is a negative number, it raises a `ValueError` because the Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative indices.

It initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to `0` and `1` respectively. These represent the first two numbers in the sequence. The function then enters a `for` loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated using tuple assignment: `a, b = b, a + b`. This operation effectively shifts the sequence forward: the new `a` takes the value of the old `b`, and the new `b` becomes the sum of the old `a` and `b`.

After the loop completes, the variable `a` holds the nth Fibonacci number. For an input of `n=0`, the loop does not execute, and the initial value of `a` (which is `0`) is returned, correctly giving F₀.

```python
# For n = 4:
# Initial: a = 0, b = 1
# Loop 1: a = 1, b = 1 (F₂)
# Loop 2: a = 1, b = 2 (F₃)
# Loop 3: a = 2, b = 3 (F₄)
# Loop 4: a = 3, b = 5 (F₅)
# Loop finishes, returns a = 3
```

The function returns the final value of `a`.

## Usage Notes

- The index `n` is 0-based. For example, `fibonacci(0)` returns `0`, and `fibonacci(1)` returns `1`.
- The function only accepts non-negative integers for the parameter `n`. Providing a negative integer will result in a `ValueError`.
- This iterative implementation is efficient in terms of memory usage, avoiding the deep recursion stack that a naive recursive solution would create, making it suitable for calculating larger Fibonacci numbers.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single integer value.
```
34
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
# Calculate the 9th Fibonacci number (0-indexed)
n_value = 9
result = fibonacci(n_value)
print(f"The Fibonacci number at index {n_value} is: {result}")

# Example with edge case n=0
result_zero = fibonacci(0)
print(f"The Fibonacci number at index 0 is: {result_zero}")
```

**Output:**

```
The Fibonacci number at index 9 is: 34
The Fibonacci number at index 0 is: 0
```

## FunctionDef choose_random_item(items)
# Function: choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str

## Overview

The `choose_random_item` function selects and returns a single, uniformly random item from a given list of strings.

## Parameters

-   **`items`** (`List[str]`): A non-empty list of strings from which one item will be randomly chosen.

## Description

This function provides a safe way to select a random element from a sequence.

The function first performs a validation check to ensure the input list `items` is not empty. If the list is empty (`if not items:`), it immediately raises a `ValueError` with the message "items must not be empty" to prevent errors in the subsequent random selection process.

If the list contains one or more elements, the function proceeds to use `random.choice(items)`. This standard library function handles the core logic of picking an element from the sequence with a uniform probability distribution, meaning every item has an equal chance of being selected. The chosen string is then returned as the output.

```python
# The function relies on the 'random' module
import random

# Example of internal logic
items_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
if not items_list:
    raise ValueError("items must not be empty")
# If the list is not empty, random.choice is called
selected_item = random.choice(items_list)
# selected_item will be "apple", "banana", or "cherry"
```

## Usage Notes

-   The input list `items` must not be empty. Providing an empty list will result in a `ValueError`.
-   This function requires the `random` module to be imported in the execution environment.
-   The selection is uniformly random, ensuring each item in the list has an equal probability of being chosen.

**Output Example**: A single string from the input list.

```
"banana"
```

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

def choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str:
    """Choose a single random item from a non-empty sequence.

    Parameters:
        items: A list of strings to choose from.

    Returns:
        A single string chosen uniformly at random.
    """
    if not items:
        raise ValueError("items must not be empty")
    return random.choice(items)

# Example usage
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
random_fruit = choose_random_item(fruits)
print(f"The randomly chosen fruit is: {random_fruit}")

# Example of error handling
try:
    choose_random_item([])
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output:**

```
The randomly chosen fruit is: cherry
Error: items must not be empty
```

***
## FunctionDef shuffle_copy(items)
# Function: shuffle_copy(items: List[int])

## Overview

The `shuffle_copy` function creates and returns a new list containing the elements of the input list in a randomized order, leaving the original list unchanged.

## parameters

- **items** (`List[int]`): A list of integers to be copied and shuffled.

## Description

This function provides a safe way to shuffle a list without altering the original data structure. The process involves two main steps:

1.  A shallow copy of the input `items` list is created using `copy = list(items)`. This step is crucial as it ensures that all subsequent operations are performed on a new list, preserving the integrity of the original list.

2.  The `random.shuffle()` method is then called on the `copy`. This function shuffles the elements of the list in-place, rearranging them into a random permutation.

3.  Finally, the function returns the `copy`, which now contains the same elements as the original `items` list but in a new, randomized order.

```python
# Internal logic
copy = list(items)
random.shuffle(copy)
return copy
```

## Usage Notes

- **Non-mutating:** This function is designed to be non-destructive. The original list passed as the `items` argument remains unchanged after the function call.
- **Dependency:** This function requires the `random` module to be imported in the script, as it utilizes `random.shuffle()` internally.
- **Randomness:** The order of the elements in the returned list is pseudo-random and will likely differ on each execution unless the random seed is explicitly set beforehand.

**Output Example**: A new list with the same elements as the input but in a different, random order. For example, `[4, 1, 5, 3, 2]` could be a possible output for an input of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

# The function definition is assumed to be present
def shuffle_copy(items: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Return a shuffled copy of the given list without mutating the input."""
    copy = list(items)
    random.shuffle(copy)
    return copy

# Example usage
original_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
shuffled_numbers = shuffle_copy(original_numbers)

print(f"Original List (unchanged): {original_numbers}")
print(f"Shuffled Copy: {shuffled_numbers}")

# Another run might produce a different order
another_shuffled_copy = shuffle_copy(original_numbers)
print(f"Another Shuffled Copy: {another_shuffled_copy}")
```

**Output:**

```
Original List (unchanged): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Shuffled Copy: [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
Another Shuffled Copy: [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]
```
