## FunctionDef num(a, b)
# Function: def num(a, b)

## Overview

The `num` function calculates and returns the sum of two input arguments.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type      | Description                   |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| `a`       | int/float | The first number to be added. |
| `b`       | int/float | The second number to be added.|

## Description

This function provides a basic arithmetic operation. It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and computes their sum using the standard addition operator (`+`). The resulting value is then returned by the function. The primary purpose is to encapsulate the addition of two numbers.

For example, if `a` is `10` and `b` is `5`, the function will compute `10 + 5` and return the integer `15`.

```python
# The function simply returns the result of a + b
return a + b
```

## Usage Notes

- This function is intended for use with numeric types such as integers (`int`) and floating-point numbers (`float`).
- If string types are provided, the function will perform string concatenation rather than mathematical addition.
- Providing incompatible types (e.g., an integer and a `None` type) will result in a `TypeError`.

**Output Example**: A numeric value representing the sum, such as `15` or `12.5`.

## Example

```python
# Example usage with two integers
result = num(5, 10)
print(result)

# Example usage with a float and an integer
float_result = num(7.5, 5)
print(float_result)
```

**Output:**

```
15
12.5
```

## FunctionDef generate_random_integers(count, start, end)
# Function: generate_random_integers(count: int, start: int = 0, end: int = 100) -> List[int]

## Overview

The `generate_random_integers` function returns a list of a specified number of pseudo-random integers within a given inclusive range.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `count` | int | The total number of integers to generate in the list. |
| `start` | int | The inclusive lower bound for the random values. Defaults to `0`. |
| `end` | int | The inclusive upper bound for the random values. Defaults to `100`. |

## Description

This function provides a convenient way to generate a list of random integers. It operates in three main steps:

1.  **Input Validation**: It first checks if the `count` parameter is a negative number. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised, as it's impossible to generate a negative number of integers.

2.  **Range Correction**: The function then compares the `start` and `end` parameters. If `start` is found to be greater than `end`, it automatically swaps their values. This ensures that `random.randint` receives a valid range (`start` <= `end`) and makes the function more robust to user input errors.

3.  **Random Number Generation**: Finally, it uses a list comprehension to generate the list of integers. It iterates `count` times, and in each iteration, it calls `random.randint(start, end)` to produce a single integer that is uniformly sampled from the inclusive range `[start, end]`. These integers are collected into a list which is then returned.

```python
# Internal logic for swapping the range
if start > end:
    start, end = end, start
# Internal logic for list generation
return [random.randint(start, end) for _ in range(count)]
```

## Usage Notes

- This function requires the `random` module to be imported.
- The `count` argument must be a non-negative integer. Providing a negative value will result in a `ValueError`.
- The range defined by `start` and `end` is inclusive, meaning both `start` and `end` can appear in the output list.
- If you provide a `start` value that is greater than the `end` value, the function will automatically swap them and proceed without error.

**Output Example**: A possible return value for `generate_random_integers(5, 1, 10)`:

```
[3, 8, 1, 10, 5]
```

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

def generate_random_integers(count: int, start: int = 0, end: int = 100) -> List[int]:
    """Return a list of pseudo-random integers.

    Parameters:
        count: Number of integers to generate.
        start: Inclusive lower bound for values.
        end: Inclusive upper bound for values.

    Returns:
        A list containing `count` integers sampled uniformly in [start, end].
    """
    if count < 0:
        raise ValueError("count must be non-negative")
    if start > end:
        start, end = end, start
    return [random.randint(start, end) for _ in range(count)]

# Example usage: Generate 5 random integers between 10 and 20.
random_numbers = generate_random_integers(count=5, start=10, end=20)
print(random_numbers)
```

**Output:**

```
[15, 11, 20, 18, 10]
```
*(Note: The actual output will vary with each execution due to the random nature of the function.)*

## FunctionDef fibonacci(n)
# Function: fibonacci(n: int)

## Overview

The `fibonacci` function computes the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach.

## parameters

- `n`: `int`
  - The 0-indexed position in the Fibonacci sequence for which to find the value.

## Description

This function calculates a Fibonacci number based on its index `n`. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

The function first validates the input `n`. If `n` is a negative number, it raises a `ValueError` because the Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative indices.

It initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to `0` and `1` respectively. These represent the first two numbers in the sequence, F(0) and F(1).

The function then enters a `for` loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, it performs a simultaneous assignment: `a, b = b, a + b`. This updates `a` to the value of `b` (the next number in the sequence) and `b` to the sum of the previous `a` and `b` (the subsequent number).

After the loop completes, the variable `a` holds the nth Fibonacci number, which is then returned.

```python
# For n = 4, the loop runs 4 times:
# Initial: a = 0, b = 1
# 1. a = 1, b = 0 + 1 = 1
# 2. a = 1, b = 1 + 1 = 2
# 3. a = 2, b = 1 + 2 = 3
# 4. a = 3, b = 2 + 3 = 5
# The loop finishes. The function returns a, which is 3.
```

## Usage Notes

- The index `n` is 0-based. For example, `fibonacci(0)` returns `0`, and `fibonacci(1)` returns `1`.
- The function will raise a `ValueError` if a negative integer is provided for the `n` parameter.
- This iterative implementation is efficient in terms of memory and performance compared to a naive recursive solution, as it avoids redundant calculations and deep recursion stacks.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single integer value.

```
55
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage to find the 10th Fibonacci number
try:
    result = fibonacci(10)
    print(f"The 10th Fibonacci number is: {result}")

    # Example with index 0
    result_zero = fibonacci(0)
    print(f"The 0th Fibonacci number is: {result_zero}")

    # Example that would raise an error
    # fibonacci(-5)

except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```

**Output:**

```
The 10th Fibonacci number is: 55
The 0th Fibonacci number is: 0
```

## FunctionDef choose_random_item(items)
# Function: choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str

## Overview

The `choose_random_item` function selects and returns a single, uniformly random item from a given list of strings.

## parameters

- **`items`** (`List[str]`): A list of strings from which to choose a random item. This list must not be empty.

## Description

This function provides a simple way to randomly select one element from a list of strings.

The function first performs a validation check to ensure the input list `items` is not empty. If the list is empty, it raises a `ValueError` to prevent the underlying `random.choice()` function from failing, as `random.choice()` cannot operate on an empty sequence.

If the list contains one or more items, the function utilizes `random.choice(items)`. This standard library function takes the list as input and returns one of its elements. The selection is uniformly random, meaning every item in the list has an equal probability of being chosen. The selected string is then returned as the result.

```python
# Internally, the function works like this:
import random

def choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str:
    # 1. Check if the list is empty
    if not items:
        # 2. Raise an error if it is
        raise ValueError("items must not be empty")
    # 3. If not empty, use random.choice to pick and return an item
    return random.choice(items)
```

## Usage Notes

- The input list `items` must not be empty. Providing an empty list will result in a `ValueError`.
- The selection is uniformly random. Each string in the list has an equal chance of being returned.
- The function is type-hinted to accept a list of strings (`List[str]`) and return a single string (`str`).

**Output Example**: A single string from the input list. For an input of `["red", "green", "blue"]`, a possible output is `"green"`.

## Example

```python
# Assumes the 'random' module is imported in the file where choose_random_item is defined.
# Example usage:
import random
from typing import List

# Definition of the function
def choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str:
    if not items:
        raise ValueError("items must not be empty")
    return random.choice(items)

# A list of options
options = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# Call the function with the list
selected_fruit = choose_random_item(options)

# Print the result
print(f"The randomly selected fruit is: {selected_fruit}")

# Example of what happens with an empty list
try:
    choose_random_item([])
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output:**

```
The randomly selected fruit is: banana
Error: items must not be empty
```
*(Note: The selected fruit will vary with each execution as it is chosen randomly.)*

***
## FunctionDef shuffle_copy(items)
# Function: shuffle_copy(items: List[int])

## Overview

The `shuffle_copy` function returns a new, randomly shuffled copy of a given list, ensuring the original list remains unchanged.

## parameters

*   `items` (`List[int]`): A list of integers that will be copied and then shuffled.

## Description

This function provides a safe way to shuffle a list without altering the original data structure. The process is executed in three main steps:

1.  A shallow copy of the input `items` list is created using the `list()` constructor. This step is crucial for preserving the original list, as any subsequent modifications will only affect the new copy.
2.  The `random.shuffle()` method is then called on this `copy`. This function shuffles the elements of the list in-place, rearranging them into a random order.
3.  Finally, the function returns the modified `copy`, which now holds the same elements as the original list but in a new, randomized sequence.

```python
# Internal logic of the function
import random

def shuffle_copy(items: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # 1. Create a shallow copy
    copy = list(items)
    # 2. Shuffle the copy in-place
    random.shuffle(copy)
    # 3. Return the shuffled copy
    return copy
```

## Usage Notes

- This function is designed to be non-mutating. The input list `items` will not be altered by the function call.
- The function depends on Python's built-in `random` module. Ensure it is imported in your project before calling this function.
- The function creates a shallow copy. For a list of integers, this is sufficient. If the list were to contain mutable objects (like other lists or dictionaries), the inner objects themselves would not be duplicated.

**Output Example**: The function returns a `list` of integers. The order of elements is random and will likely differ with each execution. For an input of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, a possible output could be:

```
[4, 1, 5, 3, 2]
```

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

# Definition of the function
def shuffle_copy(items: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Return a shuffled copy of the given list without mutating the input."""
    copy = list(items)
    random.shuffle(copy)
    return copy

# Example usage
original_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
shuffled_list = shuffle_copy(original_list)

print("Original List (unchanged):")
print(original_list)
print("\nShuffled Copy:")
print(shuffled_list)
```

**Output:**

```
Original List (unchanged):
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Shuffled Copy:
[30, 50, 10, 20, 40]
```
