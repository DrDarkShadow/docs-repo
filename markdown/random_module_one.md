## FunctionDef num(a, b)
# Function: def num(a, b)

## Overview

The `num` function calculates and returns the sum of two provided arguments.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `a` | int / float | The first number to be added. |
| `b` | int / float | The second number to be added. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to perform addition. It accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numerical values (integers or floating-point numbers). The core logic of the function uses the `+` operator to compute the sum of `a` and `b`. The resulting value is then returned to the caller.

For example, if `a` is `10` and `b` is `5`, the function will compute `10 + 5` and return `15`.

```python
# The function simply returns the result of a + b
return a+b
```

## Usage Notes

Important points to consider when using this function:

- The function relies on Python's `+` operator. Ensure that both input arguments are of types that support addition (e.g., `int`, `float`). Passing incompatible types (like an `int` and a `NoneType`) will result in a `TypeError`.
- If strings are passed as arguments, the function will perform string concatenation instead of mathematical addition. For example, `num("hello", "world")` would return `"helloworld"`.
- The data type of the returned value depends on the input types. For instance, adding an `int` and a `float` will result in a `float`.

**Output Example**: If the inputs are `15` and `20`, the function returns:

```
35
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage with integers
result = num(15, 20)
print(result)

# Example usage with floating-point numbers
float_result = num(10.5, 2.2)
print(float_result)
```

**Output:**

```
35
12.7
```

### FunctionDef num
# Function: def num(a, b)

## Overview

The `num` function is a placeholder that accepts two arguments but performs no operations and returns `None`.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `a` | Any | The first input parameter. It is not used within the function's body. |
| `b` | Any | The second input parameter. It is not used within the function's body. |

## Description

The `num` function is defined with two parameters, `a` and `b`. The function body is currently empty, meaning it contains no logic or operations. Consequently, the function does not utilize the input parameters for any computation. In Python, a function that does not have an explicit `return` statement will implicitly return the `None` object.

## Usage Notes

- This function currently acts as a stub or placeholder and lacks any functional implementation.
- Calling this function with any arguments will always result in a return value of `None`.
- It is likely intended for future development where functionality will be added.

## Example

```python
# Example usage
# The function is called with two integer arguments.
result = num(10, 20)
print(result)

# The function can be called with any data types.
result_str = num("hello", "world")
print(result_str)
```

**Output:**

```
None
None
```

## FunctionDef generate_random_integers
# Function: generate_random_integers(count: int, start: int = 0, end: int = 100)

## Overview

The `generate_random_integers` function generates a list of a specified number of pseudo-random integers within a given inclusive range.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `count` | int | The number of random integers to generate. This value must be non-negative. |
| `start` | int | The inclusive lower bound of the random number range. Defaults to `0`. |
| `end` | int | The inclusive upper bound of the random number range. Defaults to `100`. |

## Description

This function provides a convenient way to generate a list of pseudo-random integers. It operates in a few distinct steps:

1.  **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the `count` parameter is a negative number. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised, as it's impossible to generate a negative quantity of numbers.

2.  **Range Correction**: It then verifies if the `start` value is greater than the `end` value. If this condition is true, the function automatically swaps the two values. This ensures that `random.randint` receives a valid range, making the function more robust and user-friendly.

3.  **Integer Generation**: The function uses a list comprehension to efficiently generate the numbers. It iterates `count` times, and in each iteration, it calls `random.randint(start, end)`. This standard library function returns a single random integer from the uniform distribution over the inclusive range `[start, end]`.

4.  **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the complete list containing `count` randomly generated integers.

```python
# Internal logic for swapping the range
if start > end:
    start, end = end, start
# Internal logic for generating the list
return [random.randint(start, end) for _ in range(count)]
```

## Usage Notes

- The function requires the `random` module to be imported.
- A `ValueError` will be raised if a negative value is passed for the `count` parameter.
- The range defined by `start` and `end` is inclusive, meaning both `start` and `end` are potential values in the output list.
- If `start` is greater than `end`, the function will automatically swap them and proceed without error.

**Output Example**: A list of integers. The actual numbers will vary with each execution due to their random nature.

```
[42, 8, 99, 23, 76]
```

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

def generate_random_integers(count: int, start: int = 0, end: int = 100) -> List[int]:
    """Return a list of pseudo-random integers.

    Parameters:
        count: Number of integers to generate.
        start: Inclusive lower bound for values.
        end: Inclusive upper bound for values.

    Returns:
        A list containing `count` integers sampled uniformly in [start, end].
    """
    if count < 0:
        raise ValueError("count must be non-negative")
    if start > end:
        start, end = end, start
    return [random.randint(start, end) for _ in range(count)]

# Example usage: Generate 5 random integers between 10 and 20.
result = generate_random_integers(5, 10, 20)
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
[12, 19, 10, 15, 17]
```

### FunctionDef generate_random_integers
# Function: generate_random_integers(count: int, start: int = 0, end: int = 100) -> List[int]

## Overview

The `generate_random_integers` function generates a list containing a specified number of random integers within a given inclusive range.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `count` | `int` | The total number of random integers to generate. This is a required argument. |
| `start` | `int` | The inclusive lower bound of the random number range. Defaults to `0`. |
| `end` | `int` | The inclusive upper bound of the random number range. Defaults to `100`. |

## Description

This function produces a list of pseudo-random integers. The quantity of integers in the resulting list is determined by the `count` parameter.

Each integer in the list is generated within the numerical range defined by the `start` and `end` parameters. This range is inclusive, meaning that the values of `start` and `end` themselves are potential outcomes.

If the `start` and `end` parameters are not explicitly provided, the function uses a default range from `0` to `100`. The core logic involves iterating `count` times, and in each iteration, generating a single random integer that falls within the specified bounds. These integers are then collected into a list which is returned as the final output.

A conceptual implementation would be:
```python
import random

def generate_random_integers(count: int, start: int = 0, end: int = 100) -> List[int]:
    """
    Generates a list of random integers.
    """
    # Using a list comprehension for a concise implementation
    return [random.randint(start, end) for _ in range(count)]
```

## Usage Notes

- The value for `start` must be less than or equal to the value for `end`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the underlying random number generation will raise a `ValueError`.
- The `count` parameter should be a non-negative integer. If `count` is `0`, an empty list will be returned.
- The numbers generated are pseudo-random and should not be used for cryptographic purposes. For security-sensitive applications, consider using the `secrets` module.

## Example

```python
# Example 1: Generate 5 random integers using the default range (0 to 100)
default_list = generate_random_integers(5)
print(f"Generated list with default range: {default_list}")

# Example 2: Generate 10 random integers within a custom range of -50 to 50
custom_list = generate_random_integers(count=10, start=-50, end=50)
print(f"Generated list with custom range: {custom_list}")
```

**Output:**

```
# The output will vary due to the random nature of the function.
# A possible output is shown below.

Generated list with default range: [81, 12, 94, 3, 45]
Generated list with custom range: [-22, 48, 1, -15, 0, 33, -49, 19, 25, -6]
```

## FunctionDef fibonacci
# Function: fibonacci(n: int)

## Overview

The `fibonacci` function computes the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach.

## parameters

- `n`: `int`
  - The 0-indexed position in the Fibonacci sequence for which to find the value.

## Description

This function calculates a Fibonacci number based on its index `n`. The logic begins by validating the input. If `n` is a negative number, a `ValueError` is raised, as the Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative indices.

The function initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to `0` and `1` respectively. These represent the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence (F₀ and F₁).

It then enters a `for` loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated simultaneously. The current value of `b` is assigned to `a`, and the sum of the old `a` and `b` is assigned to `b`. This process effectively shifts the sequence forward one step:

```python
# Inside the loop
a, b = b, a + b
```

After the loop completes, the variable `a` holds the nth Fibonacci number. For an input of `n=0`, the loop does not execute, and the initial value of `a` (which is `0`) is returned, which is correct. For `n > 0`, the loop runs `n` times to calculate the correct value.

## Usage Notes

- The input `n` must be a non-negative integer. Providing a negative value will result in a `ValueError`.
- The function uses a 0-indexed sequence. For example, `fibonacci(0)` returns the first number (`0`), and `fibonacci(1)` returns the second number (`1`).
- This iterative implementation is memory-efficient and avoids the recursion depth issues that can occur with naive recursive solutions for large values of `n`.

**Output Example**: A possible return value for a valid input.
```
34
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
# Calculate the 9th Fibonacci number (0-indexed)
result = fibonacci(9)
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
34
```

### FunctionDef fibonacci
# Function: fibonacci(n: int)

## Overview

The `fibonacci` function calculates the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence.

## parameters

- `n` (int): A non-negative integer representing the position (index) in the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence is 0-indexed.

## Description

This function computes a number in the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence implemented by this function starts with 0 and 1.

The function handles the base cases first:
- If `n` is 0 or a negative number, it returns 0.
- If `n` is 1, it returns 1.

For any `n` greater than 1, the function iteratively calculates the value. It initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to the first two numbers of the sequence (0 and 1). It then loops `n-1` times, updating `a` and `b` in each step to represent the next pair of consecutive numbers in the sequence. The new `b` is calculated as the sum of the old `a` and `b`.

```python
# Assumed implementation logic
if n <= 0:
    return 0
elif n == 1:
    return 1
else:
    a, b = 0, 1
    # Loop n-1 times to get to the n-th element
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```

After the loop completes, the variable `b` holds the n-th Fibonacci number, which is then returned.

## Usage Notes

- The input `n` must be an integer. The function is designed for non-negative integers.
- If a negative integer is provided for `n`, the function will return 0.
- Be aware that Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. While Python's integers can handle arbitrary size, calculations for extremely large values of `n` can be computationally intensive and result in very large numbers.

## Example

```python
# Example usage
# Calculate the 9th Fibonacci number (0-indexed)
# The sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
result = fibonacci(9)
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
34
```

## FunctionDef choose_random_item
# Function: choose_random_item(items: List[str])

## Overview

The `choose_random_item` function selects and returns a single, uniformly random item from a given list of strings.

## parameters

*   **items** (`List[str]`): A non-empty list of strings from which to choose a random item.

## Description

This function provides a simple way to get a random element from a list. The logic proceeds in two main steps:

1.  **Validation**: The function first checks if the provided `items` list is empty using the condition `if not items:`. This is a crucial safeguard to ensure the function operates correctly. If the list is empty, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "items must not be empty", preventing the program from proceeding with invalid input.

2.  **Random Selection**: If the list is not empty, the function utilizes Python's built-in `random.choice(items)` method. This method takes a sequence as input and returns a single item chosen uniformly at random from that sequence. The chosen string is then returned as the output of the `choose_random_item` function.

```python
# Internal logic example
import random

def choose_random_item(items: list[str]) -> str:
    # 1. Validate that the list is not empty
    if not items:
        raise ValueError("items must not be empty")
    # 2. Return a random choice from the list
    return random.choice(items)
```

## Usage Notes

Important points to consider when using this function:

-   The input list `items` must not be empty. Providing an empty list will result in a `ValueError`.
-   This function depends on Python's `random` module. Ensure it is imported in the scope where this function is defined or called.
-   The selection is uniformly random, meaning every item in the list has an equal probability of being chosen.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single string. If the input is `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']`, a possible return value is `'banana'`.

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

# Definition of the function
def choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str:
    """Choose a single random item from a non-empty sequence."""
    if not items:
        raise ValueError("items must not be empty")
    return random.choice(items)

# Example usage
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
random_fruit = choose_random_item(fruits)
print(f"The randomly chosen fruit is: {random_fruit}")

# Example of what happens with an empty list
try:
    choose_random_item([])
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output:**

```
The randomly chosen fruit is: cherry
Error: items must not be empty
```
(Note: The chosen fruit in the first line of the output will vary with each execution.)

***
### FunctionDef choose_random_item
# Function: choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str

## Overview

The `choose_random_item` function selects and returns a single, randomly chosen element from a given list of strings.

## parameters

- `items` (`List[str]`): A list of strings from which one item will be randomly selected.

## Description

This function is designed to perform a random selection from a collection of items. It accepts a single argument, `items`, which is a list of strings.

The intended logic is to use a random selection mechanism to pick one of the strings from this list. The standard Python approach for this task is to use the `random.choice()` function from the built-in `random` module. This method takes a non-empty sequence (like a list) and returns a randomly selected element.

A complete implementation would look like the following:

```python
import random

def choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Selects and returns a single random item from a list of strings.
    """
    return random.choice(items)
```

The function takes the `items` list, passes it to `random.choice()`, and returns the resulting string.

## Usage Notes

- The input list `items` must not be empty. Providing an empty list will cause a `random.choice()` call to raise an `IndexError`.
- The selection is pseudo-random, meaning the sequence of chosen items is determined by the initial seed of the random number generator.
- While the type hint specifies `List[str]`, the underlying `random.choice()` function works with any non-empty sequence (e.g., list of integers, tuples, etc.).

## Example

The following example demonstrates the usage of the `choose_random_item` function. For this example to be executable, a sample implementation is provided.

```python
import random

# Sample implementation for the example
def choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str:
    if not items:
        raise IndexError("Cannot choose from an empty list")
    return random.choice(items)

# A list of possible choices
options = ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"]

# Call the function to get a random choice
selected_option = choose_random_item(options)

print(f"Selected Item: {selected_option}")
```

**Output:**

```
Selected Item: Option C
```
*(Note: The actual output will vary with each execution because the item is chosen randomly.)*

***
## FunctionDef shuffle_copy
# Function: shuffle_copy(items: List[int])

## Overview

The `shuffle_copy` function returns a shuffled copy of a given list of integers without modifying the original list.

## parameters

- `items` (List[int]): A list of integers to be copied and shuffled.

## Description

This function provides a safe way to shuffle a list by operating on a copy rather than the original data. The process is as follows:

1.  A shallow copy of the input `items` list is created using `copy = list(items)`. This step is crucial as it ensures that the original list passed to the function remains unchanged.
2.  The `random.shuffle()` method is then called on the `copy`. This function shuffles the elements of the `copy` list in-place, rearranging them into a random order.
3.  Finally, the function returns the modified `copy`, which now holds the same elements as the original list but in a new, randomized sequence.

```python
# Internal logic of the function
import random

def shuffle_copy(items: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Step 1: Create a shallow copy
    copy = list(items)
    # Step 2: Shuffle the copy in-place
    random.shuffle(copy)
    # Step 3: Return the shuffled copy
    return copy
```

## Usage Notes

- This function is non-mutating, meaning the original list you pass as an argument will not be altered.
- The function depends on Python's built-in `random` module. Ensure this module is available in the environment.
- The order of the elements in the returned list is non-deterministic and will be different on each execution.

**Output Example**: A new list containing the same integers as the input list, but in a random order. For an input of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, a possible output could be `[3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`.

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

# Definition of the function
def shuffle_copy(items: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Return a shuffled copy of the given list without mutating the input."""
    copy = list(items)
    random.shuffle(copy)
    return copy

# Example usage
original_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
shuffled_list = shuffle_copy(original_list)

print(f"Original List: {original_list}")
print(f"Shuffled Copy: {shuffled_list}")
```

**Output:**

```
Original List: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Shuffled Copy: [30, 50, 10, 20, 40]
```

***
### FunctionDef shuffle_copy
# Function: shuffle_copy(items: List[int])

## Overview

The `shuffle_copy` function creates and returns a new list containing the same elements as the input list but arranged in a random order.

## parameters

- `items`: `List[int]` - The list of integers to be shuffled. This list will not be modified.

## Description

This function provides a safe way to shuffle a list by operating on a copy rather than modifying the original list in place. The process is as follows:

1.  The function accepts a list of integers, `items`, as its input.
2.  It first creates a shallow copy of the `items` list. This is a crucial step to ensure that the original list passed by the caller remains unchanged.
3.  Next, it applies an in-place shuffling algorithm (such as the Fisher-Yates shuffle) to the newly created copy, randomly reordering its elements.
4.  Finally, the function returns the shuffled copy.

This non-destructive approach is useful when you need to preserve the original order of a list for other parts of your program while also working with a randomized version of it.

## Usage Notes

- The original list passed as the `items` argument is not altered. This function is non-destructive.
- The returned list will have the exact same elements and length as the input list, only in a different, random order.
- Because the shuffling is random, successive calls to `shuffle_copy` with the same input list will likely produce different output lists.

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

# A possible implementation for demonstration purposes, as the original code is a signature.
def shuffle_copy(items: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """Creates a shuffled copy of a list."""
    items_copy = items.copy()
    random.shuffle(items_copy)
    return items_copy

# Example usage
my_numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
shuffled_numbers = shuffle_copy(my_numbers)

print(f"Original list: {my_numbers}")
print(f"Shuffled copy: {shuffled_numbers}")

# Another call to show randomness
another_shuffled_copy = shuffle_copy(my_numbers)
print(f"Another shuffled copy: {another_shuffled_copy}")
```

**Output:**

```
Original list: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Shuffled copy: [30, 50, 10, 20, 40]
Another shuffled copy: [50, 20, 40, 10, 30]
```
*(Note: The actual order of elements in the shuffled lists will be random and may differ with each execution.)*
