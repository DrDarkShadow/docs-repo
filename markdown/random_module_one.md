## FunctionDef num(a, b)
Function - num:

Purpose:
Calculates and returns the sum of two input values.

Parameters:
• a: The first value to be used in the addition. This can be any data type that supports the addition operator (`+`), such as an integer, float, or string.
• b: The second value to be used in the addition. It should be of a type compatible with parameter 'a' for the addition operation to succeed.

Detailed Description:
This function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and performs an addition operation on them using Python's `+` operator. The function directly returns the result of this operation. The specific behavior of the addition depends on the data types of the input arguments; for numeric types, it performs arithmetic addition, and for sequence types like strings or lists, it performs concatenation.

Important Notes:
• The function does not perform any type checking or validation on the input parameters.
• If the provided arguments are of incompatible types for the `+` operator (e.g., an integer and a string), a `TypeError` will be raised at runtime.
• The caller is responsible for ensuring that the two arguments are compatible for addition.

**Output Example**:
```
5
```

Usage Example:
```python
# Example 1: Adding two integers
sum_integers = num(10, 5)
print(sum_integers)
# Output: 15

# Example 2: Adding two floating-point numbers
sum_floats = num(7.5, 2.5)
print(sum_floats)
# Output: 10.0

# Example 3: Concatenating two strings
concatenated_string = num("hello", " world")
print(concatenated_string)
# Output: "hello world"
```
## FunctionDef generate_random_integers(count, start, end)
Function - generate_random_integers:

Purpose:
Generates and returns a list of a specified number of pseudo-random integers within an inclusive range.

Parameters:
• count (int): The total number of integers to generate and include in the output list.
• start (int): The inclusive lower bound for the random number generation. The default value is `0`.
• end (int): The inclusive upper bound for the random number generation. The default value is `100`.

Detailed Description:
This function produces a list of pseudo-random integers based on the provided arguments. The process begins by validating the `count` parameter. If `count` is a negative number, the function immediately raises a `ValueError` to prevent an invalid operation.

Next, the function checks if the `start` value is greater than the `end` value. If this condition is true, it swaps the two values to ensure that `start` is the lower bound and `end` is the upper bound, creating a valid range for the subsequent random number generation.

Finally, the function uses a list comprehension to construct the output list. It iterates `count` times, and in each iteration, it calls `random.randint(start, end)` to generate a single integer that is uniformly sampled from the inclusive range `[start, end]`. These generated integers are collected into a list, which is then returned.

Important Notes:
• This function requires the `random` module to be imported for the `random.randint` call to work.
• A `ValueError` will be raised if the `count` argument is less than zero.
• The function gracefully handles cases where the `start` parameter is greater than the `end` parameter by automatically swapping them.
• The range for random number generation is inclusive, meaning both the `start` and `end` values can appear in the returned list.

**Output Example**:
A possible return value for `generate_random_integers(5, 1, 10)`:
```
[7, 2, 10, 5, 3]
```

Usage Example:
```python
import random
from typing import List

def generate_random_integers(count: int, start: int = 0, end: int = 100) -> List[int]:
    """Return a list of pseudo-random integers.

    Parameters:
        count: Number of integers to generate.
        start: Inclusive lower bound for values.
        end: Inclusive upper bound for values.

    Returns:
        A list containing `count` integers sampled uniformly in [start, end].
    """
    if count < 0:
        raise ValueError("count must be non-negative")
    if start > end:
        start, end = end, start
    return [random.randint(start, end) for _ in range(count)]

# Example 1: Generate 5 random integers with default range (0 to 100)
random_list_1 = generate_random_integers(5)
print(f"Generated list with default range: {random_list_1}")
# A possible output: Generated list with default range: [87, 23, 9, 75, 42]

# Example 2: Generate 3 random integers in a custom range (10 to 20)
random_list_2 = generate_random_integers(3, start=10, end=20)
print(f"Generated list with custom range: {random_list_2}")
# A possible output: Generated list with custom range: [15, 19, 11]

# Example 3: Using a reversed range (function will swap them)
random_list_3 = generate_random_integers(4, start=50, end=40)
print(f"Generated list with reversed range: {random_list_3}")
# A possible output: Generated list with reversed range: [48, 41, 45, 50]
```
## FunctionDef choose_random_item(items)
Function - choose_random_item:

Purpose:
Selects and returns a single string chosen uniformly at random from a non-empty list of strings.

Parameters:
• items (List[str]): A list of strings from which a single item will be randomly selected. This list must not be empty.

Detailed Description:
The function first performs a validation check to determine if the provided `items` list is empty. If the list contains no elements, the function raises a `ValueError` with the message "items must not be empty" to prevent errors in the subsequent random selection process.

If the list is not empty, the function utilizes the `random.choice()` method to select one element from the `items` list. The selection is uniform, ensuring that every item in the list has an equal probability of being chosen. The function then returns the selected string.

Important Notes:
• This function depends on the `choice` function from Python's built-in `random` module, which must be available in the environment.
• The function will raise a `ValueError` if an empty list is passed as an argument. Callers should either ensure the list is non-empty or handle this potential exception using a try-except block.
• While the type hint specifies `List[str]`, the underlying `random.choice()` method will work with any non-empty sequence (like a tuple or list of other types).

Output Example:
A single string element randomly chosen from the provided `items` list. For an input of `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']`, a possible return value is `'banana'`.

Usage Example:
```python
import random
from typing import List

# Assume the choose_random_item function is defined as provided.

# Example 1: Choosing from a list of options
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
random_fruit = choose_random_item(fruits)
print(f"The chosen fruit is: {random_fruit}")
# Possible Output: The chosen fruit is: cherry (output will vary on each run)

# Example 2: Demonstrating the error with an empty list
empty_list = []
try:
    choice = choose_random_item(empty_list)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
# Output: An error occurred: items must not be empty
```
## FunctionDef shuffle_copy(items)
Function - shuffle_copy:

Purpose:
Returns a shuffled copy of the given list without mutating the input.

Parameters:
• items (List[int]): A list of integers that will be copied and then shuffled.

Detailed Description:
This function provides a non-destructive way to shuffle the elements of a list. The logical flow is as follows:
1. A new list, `copy`, is created as a shallow copy of the input `items` list. This is done using the `list()` constructor, which ensures that the original list passed to the function is not modified.
2. The `random.shuffle()` function is then called on this `copy`. This function shuffles the elements of the `copy` list in-place, rearranging them into a pseudo-random order.
3. Finally, the function returns the `copy` list, which now contains the same elements as the original `items` list but in a randomized sequence.

Important Notes:
• This function requires the `random` module to be imported to use the `random.shuffle()` method.
• A primary feature of this function is that it is non-mutating. The original list provided as the `items` argument will remain unchanged after the function call.
• Although the type hint specifies `List[int]`, the function will work correctly with a list containing any type of element (e.g., strings, floats, or objects) because `random.shuffle` operates on any mutable sequence.

**Output Example**:
If the input `items` list is `[1, 8, 3, 5, 2]`, a possible return value would be:
```
[5, 1, 8, 3, 2]
```
*(Note: The actual order of elements in the returned list will be random upon each execution.)*

Usage Example:
```python
import random
from typing import List

# Assume the shuffle_copy function is defined and available.

# --- Example Usage ---
original_numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(f"Original list before call: {original_numbers}")

# Create a shuffled copy of the list
shuffled_numbers = shuffle_copy(original_numbers)

print(f"Returned shuffled list: {shuffled_numbers}")
print(f"Original list after call: {original_numbers}")

# --- Expected Output ---
# Original list before call: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Returned shuffled list: [40, 10, 50, 20, 30]  (Note: The order will be random)
# Original list after call: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```
