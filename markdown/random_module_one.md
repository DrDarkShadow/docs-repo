## FunctionDef num(a, b)
# Function: def num(a, b)

## Overview

The `num` function calculates and returns the sum of two provided arguments.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `a` | `int`, `float` | The first operand for the addition operation. |
| `b` | `int`, `float` | The second operand for the addition operation. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to perform addition. It accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be numerical values (integers or floating-point numbers). The core logic of the function is centered around the `+` operator. It computes the sum of `a` and `b` and immediately returns the resulting value.

The function's behavior is defined by Python's `+` operator. For example, if `a` is `5` and `b` is `10`, the function will execute `5 + 10` and return `15`.

```python
# The core operation of the function
return a + b
```

## Usage Notes

- This function is primarily intended for use with numeric types such as `int` and `float`.
- If strings are passed as arguments, the function will perform string concatenation instead of arithmetic addition (e.g., `num("hello", "world")` returns `"helloworld"`).
- Passing incompatible types (e.g., an `int` and a `str`) will result in a `TypeError`.

**Output Example**: A numeric value representing the sum.

```
15
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage with two integers
result = num(5, 10)
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
15
```

## FunctionDef generate_random_integers(count, start, end)
# Function: generate_random_integers(count: int, start: int = 0, end: int = 100) -> List[int]

## Overview

The `generate_random_integers` function creates and returns a list of a specified number of pseudo-random integers within a given inclusive range.

## parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `count` | int | The total number of integers to generate in the list. |
| `start` | int | The inclusive lower bound for the random values. Defaults to `0`. |
| `end` | int | The inclusive upper bound for the random values. Defaults to `100`. |

## Description

This function provides a straightforward way to generate a list of random integers. It operates in three main steps:

1.  **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the `count` parameter is a non-negative number. If `count` is less than zero, it raises a `ValueError` because it's impossible to generate a negative number of items.

2.  **Range Correction**: It then compares the `start` and `end` parameters. If `start` is found to be greater than `end`, the function automatically swaps their values. This ensures that the range is always valid for the random number generation logic that follows, preventing potential errors.

3.  **Generation**: Using a list comprehension, the function iterates `count` times. In each iteration, it calls `random.randint(start, end)` to produce a single integer that is uniformly sampled from the inclusive range `[start, end]`. These integers are collected into a list which is then returned.

```python
# Internal logic for generating 5 numbers between 1 and 10
# This assumes the random module is imported
import random
start, end = 1, 10
count = 5
result = [random.randint(start, end) for _ in range(count)]
# result might be [3, 10, 1, 7, 5]
```

## Usage Notes

- This function requires the `random` module to be imported in the script where it is used.
- A `ValueError` will be raised if the `count` argument is a negative integer.
- The range defined by `start` and `end` is inclusive, meaning both `start` and `end` can appear in the output list.
- The function gracefully handles cases where `start > end` by swapping the values internally, so the order of these arguments does not strictly matter.

**Output Example**: A list containing integers.

```
[42, 1, 99, 50, 23]
```

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

def generate_random_integers(count: int, start: int = 0, end: int = 100) -> List[int]:
    """Return a list of pseudo-random integers.

    Parameters:
        count: Number of integers to generate.
        start: Inclusive lower bound for values.
        end: Inclusive upper bound for values.

    Returns:
        A list containing `count` integers sampled uniformly in [start, end].
    """
    if count < 0:
        raise ValueError("count must be non-negative")
    if start > end:
        start, end = end, start
    return [random.randint(start, end) for _ in range(count)]

# Example usage: Generate 5 random integers between 10 and 20.
random_numbers = generate_random_integers(count=5, start=10, end=20)
print(random_numbers)
```

**Output:**

```
[15, 11, 20, 18, 11]
```

## FunctionDef fibonacci(n)
# Function: fibonacci(n: int)

## Overview

The `fibonacci` function computes the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach.

## parameters

- `n` (int): The 0-indexed position in the Fibonacci sequence for which to find the value.

## Description

This function provides an efficient, iterative method to calculate a specific number in the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.

The function first validates the input `n`. If `n` is a negative number, it raises a `ValueError` because the Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative indices.

It initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to the first two numbers of the sequence, `0` and `1`, respectively.

The core logic resides in a `for` loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated simultaneously. The current value of `b` is assigned to `a`, and the sum of the old `a` and `b` is assigned to `b`. This process effectively walks through the sequence:

- Iteration 1: `a` becomes 1, `b` becomes 1 (0+1)
- Iteration 2: `a` becomes 1, `b` becomes 2 (1+1)
- Iteration 3: `a` becomes 2, `b` becomes 3 (1+2)
- and so on...

After the loop completes `n` iterations, the variable `a` will hold the nth Fibonacci number, which is then returned.

```python
# Initialization for n=3
a, b = 0, 1

# Loop 1: range(3) -> 0
a, b = b, a + b  # a becomes 1, b becomes 1

# Loop 2: range(3) -> 1
a, b = b, a + b  # a becomes 1, b becomes 2

# Loop 3: range(3) -> 2
a, b = b, a + b  # a becomes 2, b becomes 3

# Loop finishes, return a
return a # returns 2
```

## Usage Notes

- The function uses a 0-indexed sequence, meaning `fibonacci(0)` returns the first element, which is `0`.
- The input `n` must be a non-negative integer. The function will raise a `ValueError` for any negative input.
- This iterative implementation is memory-efficient and avoids the recursion depth limits that can be an issue with naive recursive solutions for large values of `n`.

**Output Example**: The function returns a single integer value.
```
13
```

## Example

```python
# Example usage
# Calculate the 9th Fibonacci number (0-indexed)
result = fibonacci(9)
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
34
```

## FunctionDef choose_random_item(items)
# Function: choose_random_item(items: List[str])

## Overview

The `choose_random_item` function selects and returns a single, uniformly random element from a provided list of strings.

## parameters

*   **`items`** (`List[str]`): A non-empty list of strings from which a random item will be chosen.

## Description

This function provides a safe way to select a random item from a list. The logic proceeds as follows:

1.  **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the provided `items` list is empty using the `if not items:` condition.
2.  **Error Handling**: If the list is found to be empty, it immediately raises a `ValueError` with the message "items must not be empty". This prevents the program from crashing due to an invalid operation on an empty sequence.
3.  **Random Selection**: If the list is not empty, the function utilizes `random.choice(items)`. This standard library method efficiently and uniformly selects a single random element from the input sequence.
4.  **Return Value**: The randomly chosen string is then returned as the result of the function call.

```python
# The function assumes the 'random' module is imported.
import random

# Example of internal logic
items_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
if not items_list:
    raise ValueError("items must not be empty")
selected_item = random.choice(items_list)
# selected_item will be one of "apple", "banana", or "cherry"
```

## Usage Notes

- The input list `items` must not be empty. Passing an empty list will raise a `ValueError`.
- This function requires the `random` module to be imported in the execution environment.
- Each item in the list has an equal probability of being selected.

**Output Example**: A single string chosen from the input list.
`"banana"`

## Example

```python
import random
from typing import List

# Definition of the function
def choose_random_item(items: List[str]) -> str:
    """Choose a single random item from a non-empty sequence."""
    if not items:
        raise ValueError("items must not be empty")
    return random.choice(items)

# Example usage with a valid list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
random_fruit = choose_random_item(fruits)
print(f"A random fruit was chosen: {random_fruit}")

# Example of error handling with an empty list
try:
    choose_random_item([])
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error caught: {e}")
```

**Output:**

```
A random fruit was chosen: cherry
Error caught: items must not be empty
```
*(Note: The chosen fruit in the first line of the output is random and will vary with each execution.)*

***
## FunctionDef shuffle_copy(items)
# Function: shuffle_copy(items: List[int])

## Overview

The `shuffle_copy` function returns a new, randomly shuffled copy of a given list, ensuring the original list remains unchanged.

## parameters

- `items`: `List[int]`
  - A list of integers that you want to create a shuffled copy of.

## Description

This function provides a safe way to shuffle a list without modifying the original data structure, a concept known as non-mutation. The process is straightforward:

1.  A shallow copy of the input `items` list is created using `copy = list(items)`. This step is crucial as it isolates the original list from any subsequent modifications.
2.  The `random.shuffle()` function is then called on the `copy`. This function shuffles the elements of the list *in-place*, rearranging them into a random order.
3.  Finally, the function returns the modified `copy`, which now holds the same elements as the original list but in a new, randomized sequence.

By creating a copy first, the function guarantees that the list provided by the caller remains in its original state.

```python
# Demonstration of non-mutation
import random # shuffle_copy depends on the random module

original_list = [10, 20, 30]
shuffled_list = shuffle_copy(original_list)

print(f"Original list after function call: {original_list}")
# The original_list will still be [10, 20, 30]
```

## Usage Notes

- This function does not modify (mutate) the input list `items`. It always returns a new list.
- The function relies on Python's built-in `random` module. Ensure this module is imported in your script before calling `shuffle_copy`.
- The order of elements in the returned list is non-deterministic and will be different on each execution.

**Output Example**: A new list containing the same elements as the input `items` list, but in a random order.

## Example

```python
import random # This module is required for random.shuffle()

# Definition of the function (assuming it's in the same file or imported)
def shuffle_copy(items: list) -> list:
    copy = list(items)
    random.shuffle(copy)
    return copy

# Example usage
my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
shuffled_numbers = shuffle_copy(my_numbers)

print(f"Original List: {my_numbers}")
print(f"Shuffled Copy: {shuffled_numbers}")
```

**Output:**

```
Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Shuffled Copy: [4, 1, 7, 3, 5, 2, 6]
```
*(Note: The actual order of elements in "Shuffled Copy" will vary with each run.)*
