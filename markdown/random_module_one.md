## FunctionDef num(a, b)
**num**: This function calculates and returns the sum of two input values.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· a: The first operand for the addition operation. It can be a number (integer, float) or another data type that supports the `+` operator, such as a string or a list.
· b: The second operand for the addition operation. It must be of a type that is compatible with the type of parameter `a` for the `+` operator.
**Code Description**: The function `num` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. It computes the result of `a + b` and returns this result. The behavior of the `+` operator is dependent on the data types of the input arguments. If both arguments are numbers, it performs arithmetic addition. If they are strings, it performs string concatenation.
**Note**: Ensure that both arguments passed to the function are of types that can be used with the addition (`+`) operator. Attempting to add incompatible types, such as an integer and a string, will raise a `TypeError`.
**Output Example**:
```
15
```
## FunctionDef generate_random_integers(count, start, end)
**generate_random_integers**: The function of generate_random_integers is to return a list of a specified number of pseudo-random integers within a given range.

**parameters**:
· count: An integer specifying the number of random integers to generate.
· start: An optional integer representing the inclusive lower bound of the random number range. The default value is 0.
· end: An optional integer representing the inclusive upper bound of the random number range. The default value is 100.

**Code Description**:
The function `generate_random_integers` is defined to accept three parameters: `count`, `start`, and `end`, and it is type-hinted to return a list of integers. Initially, the function validates the `count` parameter. If `count` is a negative number, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "count must be non-negative", as it is impossible to generate a negative quantity of numbers. Next, it checks if the `start` value is greater than the `end` value. If this condition is true, it swaps the two values to ensure that `start` is always the lower bound and `end` is the upper bound of the range. This makes the function more flexible, as the user does not need to ensure the order of `start` and `end`. The core of the function is a list comprehension that iterates `count` times. In each iteration, it calls `random.randint(start, end)` to generate a single pseudo-random integer that is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`. These generated integers are collected into a list, which is the final return value of the function.

**Note**:
This function requires the `random` module to be imported. The function handles cases where the `start` parameter is greater than the `end` parameter by automatically swapping them. Providing a negative value for the `count` parameter will result in a `ValueError`. The range defined by `start` and `end` is inclusive, meaning both `start` and `end` values can be present in the output list.

**Output Example**:
A call to `generate_random_integers(5, 10, 20)` could produce the following list:
```
[12, 18, 10, 20, 15]
```
## FunctionDef choose_random_item(items)
**choose_random_item**: The function of choose_random_item is to select and return a single random item from a given list of strings.
**parameters**:
· items: A non-empty list of strings from which to choose an item.
**Code Description**: This function is designed to randomly pick one string from a list of strings. It accepts a single parameter, `items`, which must be a list of strings. The function first performs a validation check to ensure the provided list is not empty. If the `items` list is empty, it raises a `ValueError` with the message "items must not be empty" to prevent errors in the subsequent logic. If the list is valid and contains one or more elements, the function then utilizes the `random.choice()` method to select a single item from the list. The selection is made with uniform probability, meaning every item in the list has an equal chance of being chosen. The chosen string is then returned as the output of the function.
**Note**: This function requires the standard Python `random` module to be imported. The input list `items` must not be empty; providing an empty list will result in a `ValueError`.
**Output Example**:
'banana'
## FunctionDef shuffle_copy(items)
**shuffle_copy**: The function of shuffle_copy is to return a shuffled copy of a given list of integers without modifying the original list.
**parameters**:
· items: A list of integers (`List[int]`) that will be copied and shuffled.
**Code Description**: The function begins by creating a shallow copy of the input list `items` using the `list()` constructor and assigning it to a new variable named `copy`. This operation ensures that the original list passed to the function is not altered. Next, it utilizes the `random.shuffle()` method to rearrange the elements of the `copy` list into a random order. The `random.shuffle()` function modifies the list in-place. Finally, the function returns the `copy` list, which now contains the same elements as the original `items` list but in a new, randomized sequence.
**Note**: This function is non-mutating, meaning it does not alter the original list provided as an argument. It is a safe way to get a shuffled version of a list while preserving the original data. This behavior is distinct from `random.shuffle()`, which shuffles a list in-place and returns `None`.
**Output Example**:
Given the input `items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, a possible return value would be:
```python
[4, 1, 5, 3, 2]
```
The exact order of elements in the returned list will vary with each call to the function due to the random nature of the shuffling process.
