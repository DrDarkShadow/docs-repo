**ECharts1**: This is a Vue component that renders a pre-configured line chart displaying monthly transaction volume using the ECharts library.

**Props**: The props of this component.
· width: The width of the chart container. It is a string type and defaults to '100%'.
· height: The height of the chart container. It is a string type and defaults to '280px'.

**Code Description**: The component is implemented using Vue 3's Composition API. Its template consists of a single `div` element whose `ref` is set to `chartRef`. The `width` and `height` of this `div` are dynamically bound to the component's props.

In the `setup` function, `chartRef` is created as a reactive reference to the `div` element. The `useECharts` composable hook is then invoked with `chartRef`, which initializes an ECharts instance on the referenced DOM element and returns a `setOptions` function for configuring the chart.

The `onMounted` lifecycle hook ensures that the chart configuration is applied only after the component's DOM has been rendered. Inside this hook, the `setOptions` function is called with a specific configuration object that defines the chart's appearance and data.

The chart is configured as a smooth line chart with the following key properties:
· `tooltip`: Appears when the user hovers over the chart's x-axis, with a vertical line pointer.
· `grid`: Configured with minimal padding to maximize the chart area.
· `xAxis`: A categorical axis representing the twelve months of the year (e.g., '1月' for January).
· `yAxis`: A numerical value axis with a maximum limit of 8000.
· `series`: Contains a single data series named '成交量' (Transaction Volume). The line is rendered as a smooth curve without data point symbols. The line style features a vertical linear gradient, transitioning from a solid color (`#009688`) to a semi-transparent color. The data for the chart is hardcoded as an array of numbers.

**Note**: This component relies on the `useECharts` hook located in `@/hooks/web/useECharts` for its core chart-rendering functionality. The data displayed by the chart is static and defined within the component itself.
## FunctionDef invert_dictionary(mapping)
**EChartsProps**: Defines the properties for the ECharts React component.
**Attributes**: The attributes of this type alias.
· `option`: The ECharts chart configuration object, of type `ECOption`. This is where you define the chart's data, axes, series, title, and other visual elements.
· `style`: The CSS styles for the chart's container `div`, of type `React.CSSProperties`.
· `settings`: The settings for updating the chart, of type `SetOptionOpts`. These are passed as the second argument to the `echartsInstance.setOption` method.
· `loading`: A boolean flag that controls the display of the loading animation on the chart.
· `theme`: The theme to be used for the chart. It can be either a registered theme name (string) or a theme configuration object.
· `onEvents`: An object for binding event listeners to the chart. Keys are the ECharts event names (e.g., 'click', 'legendselectchanged'), and values are the corresponding handler functions.
· `opts`: The initialization options for the ECharts instance, of type `EChartsInitOpts`. These are passed to the `echarts.init` method when the chart is created.
· `notMerge`: A boolean that determines whether to merge with the previous option when updating the chart via `setOption`. If `true`, the new option completely replaces the old one. The default value is `false`.
· `lazyUpdate`: A boolean that, when `true`, defers the chart update. The update will be applied after the current batch of option modifications is complete. The default value is `false`.
· `onChartReady`: A callback function that is invoked when the chart instance is initialized and ready. It receives the ECharts instance as its only argument, allowing for direct interaction with the chart API.
· `loadingOption`: An object to configure the appearance and behavior of the loading animation, which is passed to the `echartsInstance.showLoading` method.
· `showLoading`: A deprecated boolean to show the loading animation. Use the `loading` prop instead.
· `echarts`: An optional property to provide a custom ECharts core object. This is useful for advanced scenarios like using a custom ECharts build or managing different ECharts versions within an application.
**Code Description**: The `EChartsProps` type is a TypeScript type alias that specifies the complete set of valid properties (props) for a React component designed to render an ECharts chart. It is constructed by taking all standard HTML attributes for a `<div>` element from `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>` and omitting the original `style` attribute. This is done to provide a more specific `style` property typed as `React.CSSProperties` for improved type-safety.

The type then adds a collection of ECharts-specific properties. The most crucial property is `option`, which holds the entire chart configuration. Other properties allow for extensive customization and control, including `style` and `theme` for visual styling, `loading` and `loadingOption` for managing the loading state, and `opts` for configuring the chart instance on initialization. It also provides props that map directly to the ECharts `setOption` API, such as `notMerge`, `lazyUpdate`, and `settings`, to fine-tune how chart options are updated. Event handling is managed through the `onEvents` object, and the `onChartReady` callback provides a way to access the underlying ECharts instance for imperative operations.
**Note**: The `showLoading` property is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. It is recommended to use the `loading` property to control the visibility of the loading animation. Many properties in `EChartsProps`, such as `opts`, `notMerge`, `lazyUpdate`, and `loadingOption`, serve as direct proxies to the parameters in the native Apache ECharts API methods (`echarts.init`, `setOption`, `showLoading`). This makes the component intuitive for developers who are already familiar with the ECharts library.
## FunctionDef is_palindrome(text)
**IsMobileBrowser**: Determines if the provided user agent string belongs to a mobile browser.
**Parameters**: The parameters of this function.
· userAgent: A `String` representing the user agent of the web client being inspected.
**Code Description**: This private helper function is used to identify whether a web request originates from a mobile browser. It takes a user agent string as input and checks for the presence of specific keywords that commonly indicate a mobile device. The logic checks if the `userAgent` string contains the substring "Mobile" or the substring "Android". If either of these keywords is found, the function determines that the client is a mobile browser.
**Note**: This method of browser detection relies on the user agent string, which is not always a guaranteed indicator of the device type, as it can be modified by the user or network proxies. This function is `private` and intended for internal use within the `PaylikeClient` class.
**Return**: The function returns a `Bool` value. It returns `true` if the `userAgent` string contains "Mobile" or "Android", indicating a mobile browser. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
