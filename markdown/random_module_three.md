**CancellationToken**: The CancellationToken struct propagates notifications that an operation should be canceled.

**Properties**:
· None: A static property that returns a cancellation token which can never be in a canceled state. It is useful for methods that require a `CancellationToken` but for which cancellation is not desired.
· IsCancellationRequested: A boolean property that indicates whether cancellation has been requested for this token. If `true`, the listening operation should terminate.
· CanBeCanceled: A boolean property that indicates whether this token has the capability of being canceled. If `false`, `IsCancellationRequested` will always be `false`.
· WaitHandle: Gets a `System.Threading.WaitHandle` that is signaled when the token is canceled. This allows cancellation to be integrated with other synchronization mechanisms that rely on `WaitHandle` objects.

**Code Description**:
`CancellationToken` is a lightweight struct used to implement a cooperative cancellation model for asynchronous or long-running operations. It provides a unified mechanism for requesting the cancellation of one or more operations. A `CancellationToken` does not initiate cancellation itself; rather, it acts as a listener for a cancellation request issued by a `CancellationTokenSource`.

Operations that support cancellation accept a `CancellationToken` as a parameter. The code within the operation can then monitor the state of this token. There are three primary ways to do this:
1.  **Polling**: The operation can periodically check the value of the `IsCancellationRequested` property. If this property returns `true`, the operation should stop its work gracefully, clean up any resources, and exit.
2.  **Callback Registration**: A callback delegate can be registered with the token by calling the `Register` method. This delegate will be executed once when the associated `CancellationTokenSource`'s `Cancel` method is called.
3.  **Exception Throwing**: The `ThrowIfCancellationRequested` method provides a convenient way to handle cancellation. It checks if `IsCancellationRequested` is `true`, and if so, throws an `OperationCanceledException`. This pattern is commonly used in asynchronous methods to transition the associated `Task` into the `Canceled` state.

The default constructor (`new CancellationToken()`) creates a token that cannot be canceled, which is equivalent to the `CancellationToken.None` property. `CancellationToken.None` is the idiomatic and recommended way to obtain a non-cancelable token.

**Relationship with CancellationTokenSource**:
A `CancellationToken` is created and managed by an instance of the `CancellationTokenSource` class. You obtain a token from a source by accessing its `Token` property. A single `CancellationTokenSource` can provide tokens for multiple operations. When the `Cancel()` method is called on the `CancellationTokenSource`, all copies of the `CancellationToken` obtained from that source will transition to the canceled state, and their `IsCancellationRequested` property will become `true`.

**Note**:
Because `CancellationToken` is a struct (a value type), it is efficient to pass as a parameter to methods. It is the responsibility of the code receiving the `CancellationToken` to monitor it and respond to a cancellation request. The cancellation is cooperative and not preemptive; the operation will not be forcibly terminated against its will.

**Return Value of Register Method**:
The `Register` method returns a `CancellationTokenRegistration` object. This object represents the registration of the callback delegate. To unregister the callback and prevent it from being called (for example, if the operation completes successfully), you can call the `Dispose` or `Unregister` method on the returned `CancellationTokenRegistration` object. This is important for preventing resource leaks and unintended behavior.
## FunctionDef invert_dictionary(mapping)
**EChartsBaseController**: Provides an abstract base structure for controllers that generate and save ECharts visualizations.
**Attributes**: The attributes of this class.
· data_path (str): The file path for the input data.
· save_path (str): The directory path where the generated chart HTML file will be saved.
· file_name (str): The name of the output HTML file.
· chart (object): A placeholder for the ECharts chart instance. It is initialized as `None` and should be assigned a chart object in the `init_echarts_options` method of a subclass.
· data_frame (object): A placeholder for the loaded data, typically a pandas DataFrame. It is initialized as `None` and populated by the `load_data` method of a subclass.
**Code Description**: The `EChartsBaseController` is an abstract base class (`ABC`) that defines a standardized workflow for creating ECharts charts. It is designed to be inherited, not instantiated directly. The constructor (`__init__`) initializes the controller with paths for data input and chart output. Upon initialization, it sequentially calls the `load_data` and `init_echarts_options` methods to orchestrate the chart creation process.

The class includes two abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass:
· `load_data()`: This method is responsible for loading data from the path specified by the `data_path` attribute and storing it, typically in the `data_frame` attribute.
· `init_echarts_options()`: This method is responsible for creating a specific ECharts chart instance (e.g., a Bar or Line chart from `pyecharts`), configuring its options using the loaded data, and assigning it to the `self.chart` attribute.

The class also provides a concrete method, `save_echarts()`. This method handles the file-saving logic. It first ensures that the target directory specified by `save_path` exists, creating it if necessary. It then combines the `save_path` and `file_name` to form the full destination path and calls the `render()` method on the `self.chart` object to generate and save the chart as an HTML file. A confirmation message indicating the save location is printed to the console.
**Relationship**: This class serves as a parent class for more specific chart controllers. Subclasses must inherit from `EChartsBaseController` and provide concrete implementations for the `load_data` and `init_echarts_options` abstract methods to create a functional chart generator for a specific chart type.
**Note**: Since `EChartsBaseController` is an abstract base class, you cannot create an instance of it directly. You must create a subclass that implements the `load_data` and `init_echarts_options` methods. The `save_echarts` method assumes that the object assigned to `self.chart` has a `render(path)` method, which is standard for chart objects in libraries like `pyecharts`.
## FunctionDef is_palindrome(text)
**remove**: The function of remove is to remove the first occurrence of a specified value from an array.
**Parameters**: The parameters of this function.
· array: T[]: The source array from which the value will be removed. It is a generic array, meaning it can contain elements of any type.
· value: T: The value to be removed from the array. Its type must match the element type of the array.
**Code Description**: This is a generic function designed to operate on an array of any type `T`. It takes an array and a value as input. The function first uses the `indexOf` method to find the index of the first occurrence of the specified `value` within the `array`. If the `value` is found (meaning the returned index is not -1), the function then calls the `splice` method on the array. The `splice(index, 1)` call removes one element at the found index, thereby modifying the original array in place. Finally, the function returns the array. If the specified `value` is not found in the array, no changes are made, and the original array is returned.
**Note**: This function mutates the original array passed as the `array` argument. If the array contains multiple instances of the same value, only the first one encountered will be removed.
**Return Value**: The function returns the modified input `array`. If the value was not found in the array, it returns the original, unmodified array.
