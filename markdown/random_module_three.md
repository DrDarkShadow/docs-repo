## FunctionDef fibonacci(n)
**FGDAssetsModule**: The function of FGDAssetsModule is to provide a static utility for loading and caching game assets, specifically textures, to optimize performance.
**Attributes**: The attributes of this class.
· _cache: A private static `Dictionary<string, Texture2D>` used to store texture assets that have already been loaded. It uses the asset's file path as the key and the `Texture2D` object as the value.
**Code Description**: The FGDAssetsModule class serves as a centralized asset management utility. It features a static method, `GetSprite`, which is designed to retrieve `Texture2D` resources efficiently. When `GetSprite` is called with a resource path, it first checks an internal static cache, `_cache`, to determine if the texture has been previously loaded. If a cached version exists, it is returned immediately, which avoids redundant disk access and improves performance. If the texture is not found in the cache, the method proceeds to load it from the specified path using Godot's `ResourceLoader.Load<Texture2D>()`. Once the texture is successfully loaded, it is added to the `_cache` so that subsequent requests for the same asset can be served from memory. This caching strategy ensures that each unique texture is loaded from the file system only once per application session.
**Note**: Since this is a static class, you do not need to create an instance of `FGDAssetsModule` to use its methods. The cache persists for the lifetime of the application run. If an asset on disk is changed while the application is running, the old, cached version will continue to be returned until the application is restarted.
**Return**: The return value of this class's methods.
· GetSprite(string path): Returns the `Texture2D` object corresponding to the given path. If the texture is already in the cache, the cached instance is returned. Otherwise, it is loaded from the file system, added to the cache, and then returned. If `ResourceLoader.Load` fails to find or load the resource at the given path, this method will return `null`.
## FunctionDef invert_dictionary(mapping)
**create_channel**: The function of create_channel is to create and return a `ProphetChannel` instance, which is a gRPC channel for communicating with the server.

**Parameters**:
· target: The server address to connect to, formatted as a string (e.g., 'host:port').
· root_certificates: Optional. The PEM-encoded root certificates for server authentication in a secure TLS connection. Defaults to `None`.
· private_key: Optional. The PEM-encoded private key for client authentication in a mutual TLS setup. Defaults to `None`.
· certificate_chain: Optional. The PEM-encoded certificate chain for client authentication in a mutual TLS setup. Defaults to `None`.
· options: An optional list of key-value tuples (`List[Tuple[str, Any]]`) to configure the underlying gRPC channel. This is a keyword-only argument.
· compression: Optional. A gRPC compression method, such as `grpc.Compression.Gzip`, to be used on the channel. This is a keyword-only argument.
· keepalive_time_ms: An integer specifying the gRPC keepalive time in milliseconds. If set to a positive value, it sends periodic pings to keep the connection alive. A value of 0 disables this feature. The default is 0. This is a keyword-only argument.

**Code Description**: This function serves as a factory for creating `ProphetChannel` objects. It simplifies the instantiation process by accepting all necessary configuration parameters for a gRPC channel. The parameters include the server's `target` address, security credentials for establishing a secure connection (`root_certificates`, `private_key`, `certificate_chain`), and other advanced gRPC settings like `options`, `compression`, and `keepalive_time_ms`. The function takes all the provided arguments and forwards them directly to the constructor of the `ProphetChannel` class, subsequently returning the newly created instance.

**Note**: To establish a secure channel, the `root_certificates` parameter must be provided. If it is omitted, an insecure channel will be created. The `private_key` and `certificate_chain` parameters are only used for client-side authentication in a mutual TLS (mTLS) scenario and also require `root_certificates` to be set.

**Returns**:
**ProphetChannel**: The function returns a `ProphetChannel` object. This object represents the communication channel to the gRPC server and can be used to invoke remote procedures. It is designed to be used as a context manager (with a `with` statement) to ensure that the channel is properly closed after use.
## FunctionDef is_palindrome(text)
**add_document**: The function of add_document is to add a single document to the knowledge base.
**Parameters**: The parameters of this method.
· document: A `Document` object to be added to the knowledge base.
**Code Description**: This method is responsible for incorporating a new document into the vector store managed by the `KnowledgeBase`. The process begins with a check to determine if the internal vector store, `self.vector_store`, has been initialized. If the vector store is `None`, it signifies that this is the first document being added to the knowledge base. In this case, the method calls the private helper method `_initialize_vector_store`, passing the new document within a list to create and configure the vector store. If the `vector_store` already exists, the method simply adds the new document to the existing store by calling the `add_documents` method of the `vector_store` instance.
**Note**: The vector store is initialized lazily. It is only created upon the addition of the first document, either through this method or the `add_documents` method.
